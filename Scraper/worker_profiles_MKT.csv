I have worked on Upwork since 2009, so there is a lot of history.  I have earned over $300,000 with over 160+ jobs.  

My website is madison worldwide dot com. 


With my recommendations and implementation, I more often allow your company to produce greater results at less spend.  I know I command a higher rate on Upwork, but with over $300,000+ earned on Upwork as well as the fact that I have been asked to do publicity for Upwork in the past, I hope you will give me a chance to get great results for your company.     

I I am also a big believer in analytics.  They are the only way to prove what marketing tactics are working for you and your company.  Every business is unique and although there are tactics that work better than others for most companies, constant message testing, and utilization of unique tools and strategies and A/B testing should always be employed. 

As you will note, my background is both broad and deep and involves agency and client side marketing, entertainment marketing, heavy online marketing, experiential/event marketing, sponsorship, traditional advertising, guerrilla marketing, social media and other forms of emerging and engagement media as well as significant technology marketing including SaaS, Apps and various other technology products and services. 

What is my background?  I am glad you asked. 

With my high profile corporate experience as a foundation, I enjoy helping smaller clients and entrepreneurs bring their visions to life.  My past experience is working for big advertising agencies such as BBDO, Y&R, Ogilvy & Mather and DDB working on Healthcare, Automotive, and Consumer brands such as Starbucks. Then, I went client side and worked for Hilton Hotels for almost 10 years in a senior marketing position overseeing their worldwide corporate partners such as Coca Cola and the Olympics on behalf of all the brands under the Hilton Umbrella. Then I went on to Entertainment and Philanthropy contract positions with Live Earth, TED, and XPRIZE Foundation. 

With my own company, I have helped over 200 companies become more successful in their marketing strategies and campaigns.  I enjoy both small and large companies and very much like long term projects. 


        Here are some additional areas I have a lot of experience in: 

	Branding 
	Public Relations
	Content Marketing Strategies, Development and Implementation
	Blog Outreach 
	Sales Funnels
	AI Marketing 
	Online Digital Strategy and Implementation 
	Graphic Design (Social Media Promotions, Brochures, Direct Mail)

	SEO Improvement
               
I have proven my ability to lead strategy and development of any campaign, brand or initiative involving many stakeholders and am adept at gaining consensus across multiple constituents when necessary.  In other words, I play well with others.

38,"Social Media Marketing, Digital Advertising and E-Commerce Sales",$15.00/hr,"With my MBA and over 15 years of extensive experience in digital marketing, sales, and advertising, I've honed my skills as a social media marketer, holding credentials from Meta (October 2023), Facebook, Instagram, Google, and YouTube. I worked with prominent brands in the US as well as with Silicon Valley software companies, American healthcare firms, and British e-commerce businesses.

Social Media & Content:
I'm confident in my ability to deliver results, including a minimum 1.2x return on your investment within four months. If you're not satisfied, you won't have to pay a single penny (Given that Blue Stout, a CRO agency in the US, guarantees a 2x return on investment, I'm well-acquainted with this practice). Working with Monginis, a food and beverage brand, I increased their e-commerce website sales revenues by a staggering 10x without paid ads.

I'm a seasoned expert in crafting and producing English content for a wide range of mediums, including email newsletters, social media posts, captions, videos, company profiles, website pages, and more.

During my tenure as a full-time digital marketing manager at the UK-based Deventi Group, I led the growth of Claritas Books' online sales revenues year over year by an impressive 50%. Furthermore, I elevated website traffic from social media from 10% to a remarkable 30%. I achieved a 3x increase in the growth of subscribers for their YouTube channel (Already has millions of subscribers). Our collaboration with UNHCR (UN organization) leveraged the digital presence of their Swedish musician Maher Zain (35 million followers on Instagram and Facebook) as the top source of donations and traffic to their website.

For VIVA Investment Partners, headquartered in Switzerland, I effectively crafted their content, including email marketing (all in English), for 2 years including the 2022 and 2021 annual conference ""Follow the Entrepreneur,"" resulting in impressive year-over-year growth:
+28% in LinkedIn followers
+953% in Twitter followers
+526% in Instagram followers
+3% in Facebook fans
+144% in YouTube views
+63% in YouTube subscribers

For Unifonic, a Dubai-based IT solutions regional giant, I achieved a 50% increase in website traffic and an 18% increase in traffic from Facebook.

What Makes Me Unique:
I'm among the select few social media and digital marketing freelancers who prioritize delivering tangible results and measurable outcomes over boasting impressive client lists. If you're investing in digital marketing activities but not achieving the desired sales growth, you can rely on me to swiftly identify the root causes. In just a 30-minute call, I can share my screen, guiding you through your customer journey, highlighting and addressing issues that prevent your website visitors, ad audience, or social media followers from converting (e.g., making purchases or subscribing). You can rely on me for transparent communication regarding my capabilities, my willingness to learn and adapt, and when I may need assistance from others.

Besides my extensive 15 years of experience and an MBA degree, I've received enthusiastic reviews and recommendations from clients in both the US and the UK, both on Upwork and LinkedIn. Several have been pleasantly surprised by my nearly native-level proficiency in English, a credit to my prior work experience with UK and US-based organizations, and my university and post-graduate degrees, which were conducted in English

I am your all-in-one digital marketing solution. My IT engineering background equips me to handle various technical aspects, including expertise in YouTube and Facebook copyrights, monetization, and the management of websites and landing pages on platforms such as Unbounce, Shopify, PrestaShop, WordPress, Magento, SquareSpace, Blogger, and others. My certificates, some were earned through training courses at Google's Dubai premises, attest to my proficiency.

In addition to the mentioned tools, I am well-versed in a plethora of platforms and AI applications, including HubSpot, Windows Movie Editor, Canva, Active Campaign, iContact, Trello, Slack, Moz, Mailchimp, Hootsuite, Buffer, Sprout Social, Mention, Bit.ly, Google Trends, Hotjar, Loom, Tinyurl, and more.

I've joined the United Nations as a social media consultant.

With only $850,000 in funding in 2011, the company did $12.5M in revenues for 2015. And before that funding, they bootstrapped.

How did they reach this success without spending millions of dollars on advertising? 

Sure, they had a great product. But according to their CEO, Rick Perreault, it came down to creating amazing content for their audience from day one.

“The Question We Had From The Beginning Was ‘How Are We Going To Find Customers? People Didn’t Even Know To Look For Us, So How Will We Go Out And Find Them? So That Was A Really Important Challenge For Us To Tackle, And We Made The Decision To Start Blogging On Day One.""

-Rick Perreault, CEO Of Unbounce

This is how I help businesses.

By helping them create a winning content strategy.

The crux of the strategy is to create the most helpful content for your target audience, and promote the shit out of it.

Each of our blog post takes around 10 to 20 hours to research and write the best post on the topic.

These are not 500 words blog posts, but a complete resource (over ~2000 words) on the topic that we make sure that the target audience is interested in.

If you're seriously considering investing in content marketing, then I can help you get results.

And why wouldn't you consider content marketing? 

After all, it has an influence over other strategies.

Your content marketing efforts can have an affect on almost any other online strategy you have. For example:

* Want people signing up to your email list? Content can drive that.
	
* Working on SEO strategy? Relevant, quality content can help drive traffic and boost your SEO.
	
* Wondering what to post on social media? Sharing your blog posts is one important strategy.
	
* Want to find a way to connect with influencers or make other valuable contacts? Mentioning them in your content gives you a good excuse to reach out on social media.

* Looking for a better way to onboard your SaaS sign ups and give them the information they need for success? Do it with content!

Basically, content can form the basis of many of your other strategies, including as a lure to drive more traffic to your website.

53,Certified HubSpot & ZOHO Expert | HubSpot Dev | Business Automations,$35.00/hr,"Hey there! I am a certified HubSpot and Zoho expert and developer, ready to help you implement and optimize your systems to meet your specific marketing, sales, and customer success goals.

➤ First, I analyze your processes and use cases to understand your unique needs and recommend the best solutions for HubSpot and Zoho based on your tech stack.

➤ Then, I create visual process maps from both HubSpot and Zoho implementation perspectives — outlining properties, email workflows, utility workflows, marketing funnels, custom reports, automation workflows, and data syncing between systems.

➤ I support seamless migration from other CRMs like Zoho to HubSpot (or vice versa) and configure the tools for maximum efficiency, whether you need robust marketing automation or streamlined sales processes.

➤ I help your teams adopt HubSpot and Zoho by providing customized training sessions for marketing, sales, and CXO roles to ensure optimal usage and smooth transitions.

➤ As a certified expert in both platforms, I oversee everything, continuously monitoring your data for optimization opportunities across both Zoho and HubSpot environments.

I’ve had the pleasure of working with companies of various sizes and industries, including B2B SaaS, finance, advertising, marketing, real estate, information services, fashion, agriculture, and more. Here are some of my key achievements in the 2022-24 period:

🏆 Completed over 300 end-to-end implementations for HubSpot Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub, and Zoho CRM, Zoho Campaigns, and Zoho Books.

🏆 Worked with companies ranging from 10,000+ employees to 20-100, 100-500, and 500+ employees. Getting an understanding of the nature of work and requests at scale has helped me develop my skill set tremendously.

🏆 Migrated over 50 companies from platforms such as Marketo, Pardot, Salesforce, Zoho, ActiveCampaign, and HubSpot, ensuring data accuracy and functional continuity.

🏆 Developed intelligent marketing attribution models, intelligent lead routing, and automated nurturing sequences in both HubSpot and Zoho, customizing these solutions to meet the exact needs of the client.

🏆 Built over 500 dashboards and custom reports across both platforms, providing detailed analytics and business insights to key stakeholders like the VP of Sales, VP of Marketing, COO, and CEO.

🏆 Conducted over 200 strategic audits of HubSpot and Zoho systems to uncover areas of improvement, deliver ROI insights, and optimize workflows.

I've been fortunate to work with wonderful people over the last few years, and this is what they say about me:

🗣 We initially contracted with Anushree as a HubSpot expert to support our transition from Salesforce to HubSpot. The transition went so well and they provided such great strategic support (in addition to tactical) that we enlisted her to expand our HubSpot footprint with Sales Hub, CS Hub, and Operations Hub. 
- CMO, B2B SaaS company (joined when they were 35 people, currently 200+ people) 

🗣 Our specific division was new to HubSpot and is using it for learner enrolment for training so the use case was fairly specialized. Anushree is a HubSpot specialist and was able to develop user flow journeys and implement solutions to address our business needs. Our work is time sensitive and we receive quick replies and high-quality work. We also appreciate their question and recommendations which often lead to better solutions.
- Marketing Director, Publishing company (10,000+)

*Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn:

Instagram:
This is truly were my love and passion for social media truly started. It all started in 2012. I discovered an app lying around the app store and installed it. The app was called Instagram. At this time, Instagram still wasn't known nor was there a boom of bloggers and influencers. This is where I trult shined I was one of the very first ones to go and create my very own live travel show called ""thehappysolotraveler."" It was an instant hit! From zero I had ended up thousands of followers! Before I knew it, I actually became a local online celebrity in my own country, The Philippines. I was a hit! It was from there I learned all the basics and techniques of social media alone. My very personal account opened my eyes to social media and its secrets as a whole. To the point I finally ventured in lending my talent and gift at Instagram to my clients. From there on, everything just went smooth sailing. I love Instagram. My main specialty indeed for the social media world. 

Twitter:
I managed over 100+ Twitter accounts for my clients here in Upwork and was able to truly build their handle with that targeted potential audience that definitely met the client's field. So for example you're a author, I can target you people whom I feel can truly relate to what you have to offer and share in the social media world. I'll target perhaps writers, book lovers, etc. If you're a real estate agent or real estate ghost writer, I can target you local people in your area, realtors, home seekers, etc. I always see to it that my very best is given  and to make sure I build following all the strict rules of the site and avoid bots and fake followers as a whole.

LinkedIn:
I managed over 70+ LinkedIn accounts for my clients here in Upwork. I guarantee you potential targeted connects in your field as well following all the rules of the site.

Do you want to have this part of your business finally 100% handled so you can focus on other things?

★★★★★ - Laura Y - Shopbettermortgages | ""Darren is an exceptional Google Ads professional. I highly recommend him to anyone that's looking for a Google Ads expert.""

✅ Successfully managed Google ads for more than 75 unique industries:
✅ Client Reviews: I focus on providing VALUE to all of my Clients
✅ Over-Delivering: I take pride in leaving all of my Clients saying ""WOW
✅ Responsiveness: Being extremely responsive
✅ Kindness: Treating everyone with respect, understanding all situations, and genuinely wanting to IMPROVE my Client's situations.

Are you tired of working with unreliable freelancers who are big on promises but never really deliver?

You've probably noticed that most freelancers/ agencies will promise that they can do whatever you want, designed to take your money for as long as they can get away with it:

💸 Facebook ads
💸 Email marketing
💸 Copywriting
💸 Walking your dog 🐕

The list is endless and so are their excuses when they don't deliver quality results.

This is whats known in the industry as 'running a client through the mill'. Don't fall for it.

I DO NOT take on clients if I'm not confident i can generate leads for their business. It’s simply not something that I do.

Working with me means no more fluff, no more empty promises, no more missed delivery dates…

A lot of businesses come to me asking for my help with Google Ads but I don’t take the majority on as clients because Google ads are not suitable for every business.

Most freelancers won't tell you that though, they will take your money for as long as they can, they will promise that the results you want are ""just around the corner"", or ""Next month you will have profit from your ads""

Sound familiar? I've been there myself, lost a lot of time and money... (sniffle) 😔

I take the time to learn about your business.

It's for this reason that I will only take on new clients (maximum 1 per month) who I'm confident I can get results for and have long lasting business relationships with.

Save yourself years of trouble and money, and let's have a chat to see if Google Ads could actually make money for your business..

Invite me to your job or send me a message and I will point you in the right direction if Google Ads are not what you need.

If we establish that Google ads could potentially work for you, then and only then will we can talk about working together and creating a campaign that will put your ads far ahead of your competitors and tap into their profits.

Unless you hire a Google Ads specific expert who knows what they are doing with your money… You are going to continue to lose it..

So what now?

If you've read to this point, and I appreciate that, I'd love to hear about what exactly you need help with.

☎️____________ MESSAGE ME ____________☎️
**GET 30 MINUTE STRATEGY CONSULTATION**

I've learned that, while there may be similarities between my clients, each one is a unique company with its own unique business needs and goals.

Please send me a message and tell me a bit about your situation and what you're trying to accomplish.

Then I'll help you come up with a plan for tackling your unique project .

Thanks for reading!

73,Klaviyo & Retention Expert | E-Commerce Email & SMS Marketing,$97.00/hr,"Struggling with low customer conversion & retention rates than you’re aiming for?

Ready to kickstart your backend marketing channels’ performance and grow your e-commerce store to the next stage?

You’re now closer to the solution than ever before, because I've gotten the set-up & management of backend marketing channels down to a science, which has helped me generate over $75 million dollars in Klaviyo-attributed revenue for the brands I’ve partnered with over the last 4 years.

That’s 115 e-commerce stores that I’ve personally helped improve retention, email, and SMS marketing results for.

Curious about my journey & the brands I’ve helped over the years?

Take a look at 🌐 springmediainc.com 🌐.

What’s my secret?

I’ve pioneered a custom retention, email, & SMS marketing strategy blueprint to boost e-commerce brands’ store revenues by an extra 20-50% within 60-90 days, consistently.

Instead of the generic, wide-net approach you’ve seen before, I place my focus more on strategically crafting personalized content & messages using proven customer retention strategies to convert & retain your ideal customers more effectively.

Here’s what to expect from a true email & retention expert partnering with your brand:

- Larger, more qualified email list (more subscribers = more opportunities = more buyers)
- Better email deliverability (never land in the spam folder)
- Increased conversion rates on flows and campaigns (open rates, click-through rates)
- Higher customer retention (revenue per recipient, customer lifetime value)
- Continuous management of flows, forms, list, and campaigns
- Continuous optimization of flows, forms, and campaigns
- Monthly, highly-personalized strategy plans
- Deliverability assessments, reporting, and optimizations
- App integration set-up & management

In 2024, it’s crucial that your e-commerce store has high-converting backend marketing systems to keep you not only top of mind with your customers, but also boost your bottom line to give your store that extra push in revenue every month.

I’ll do everything from:

- In-depth auditing of your Klaviyo (or platform of choice) account
- Custom, personalized strategic planning of email/SMS flows & campaigns
- Creating & setting up all email/SMS flows
- Sending out of weekly email/SMS campaigns
- Weekly email/SMS campaign performance reviews
- Monthly email/SMS flow performance & list growth reviews
- Cleaning, segmenting, and managing your email/SMS list
- Technical & creative split-testing of emails/SMS
- Meeting with you to align your marketing with monthly strategy plans

All you have to do is get set up with me and I’ll do the rest so you can focus on growing your business.

Now, here's what I’d love to do if you’re open to it, let's chat over a discovery call where we can:

- Dive into your business & overall marketing goals
- Pinpoint the hurdles holding back your e-commerce store’s growth
- See if I can strengthen your back-end systems (if we’re a good fit)

If you’re truly committed to elevating your e-commerce store’s revenue & profits, and eager to see tangible results, then hit the “Message” button at the top right of this page and let's schedule a time to see how I can help your brand.

85,Digital Marketing Consultant,$310.00/hr,"Hi everyone!

My name is Haris Aslanidis. I’m the Founder of the Greek Geeks digital team, co-Founder of APE1R0N Digital Marketing Agency, and Head of Digital at VeSquad of Moro Global group. 

Gaining a lot of experience in computer evolution from a very young age, made me dream of following a career in that working field. So I made my dream come true by becoming an IT expert.

My career journey started as a Computer geek for several local businesses. I progressed to positions of increasing responsibility in larger Greek corporations until I finally decided to work abroad.
 
When I first started working in international positions, my level of English was very good, so it was suitable for the partnership, and I had success in the field of online presence for businesses, which resulted in positive comments and an increase in my rating. I currently have 24 years of Digital Marketing experience and that experience continues to grow on a daily basis because as a personality I'm always looking for innovative ideas, concepts, and goals to reach for. 
 
Because of the high unemployment rate in my country at the time, I founded my own agency, Greek Geeks, to help individuals find jobs remotely. With my knowledge and success, I considered I could use these abilities in order to build something bigger and better. 

Currently, we have more than 800 active contracts and our team consists of more than 40 people. Web and app development, graphic design, content generation, marketing strategy, and advertising are just some of the services we provide.

 More specifically, our services are:

* Social Media Consulting
* Digital Presence
* Digital Marketing Strategy
* Ads Conversion
* Public Relations
* Company Message Delivery to the audience
* Business Development

We also created the Ape1r0n Digital Universe, a greek business focusing on the Omni Channel digital presence of companies and the best possible results in mind. 
 
Additionally, I occupy the position of the Head of Digital at Vesquad, which is a subsidiary of Moro Global. We support startups and help them to grow having a partner mindset.

Furthermore, I and two of my partners created a website, Spoudaia Events, which is a non-profit organization, solely for philanthropic purposes and events for NGOs.

When I'm not working, I enjoy traveling, attending concerts and sports events, discovering new locations, visiting friends all around the world, participating in never-ending education seminars, reading books, watching movies, listening to music, and developing new, innovative ideas. 

I believe that everyone has to offer something to this world that we are living in and I'm trying my best regarding this part as I encourage every single one of you to do the same.

Let’s make an impact!

93,Digital Marketing Consultant,$310.00/hr,"Hi everyone!

My name is Haris Aslanidis. I’m the Founder of the Greek Geeks digital team, co-Founder of APE1R0N Digital Marketing Agency, and Head of Digital at VeSquad of Moro Global group. 

Gaining a lot of experience in computer evolution from a very young age, made me dream of following a career in that working field. So I made my dream come true by becoming an IT expert.

My career journey started as a Computer geek for several local businesses. I progressed to positions of increasing responsibility in larger Greek corporations until I finally decided to work abroad.
 
When I first started working in international positions, my level of English was very good, so it was suitable for the partnership, and I had success in the field of online presence for businesses, which resulted in positive comments and an increase in my rating. I currently have 24 years of Digital Marketing experience and that experience continues to grow on a daily basis because as a personality I'm always looking for innovative ideas, concepts, and goals to reach for. 
 
Because of the high unemployment rate in my country at the time, I founded my own agency, Greek Geeks, to help individuals find jobs remotely. With my knowledge and success, I considered I could use these abilities in order to build something bigger and better. 

Currently, we have more than 800 active contracts and our team consists of more than 40 people. Web and app development, graphic design, content generation, marketing strategy, and advertising are just some of the services we provide.

 More specifically, our services are:

* Social Media Consulting
* Digital Presence
* Digital Marketing Strategy
* Ads Conversion
* Public Relations
* Company Message Delivery to the audience
* Business Development

We also created the Ape1r0n Digital Universe, a greek business focusing on the Omni Channel digital presence of companies and the best possible results in mind. 
 
Additionally, I occupy the position of the Head of Digital at Vesquad, which is a subsidiary of Moro Global. We support startups and help them to grow having a partner mindset.

Furthermore, I and two of my partners created a website, Spoudaia Events, which is a non-profit organization, solely for philanthropic purposes and events for NGOs.

When I'm not working, I enjoy traveling, attending concerts and sports events, discovering new locations, visiting friends all around the world, participating in never-ending education seminars, reading books, watching movies, listening to music, and developing new, innovative ideas. 

I believe that everyone has to offer something to this world that we are living in and I'm trying my best regarding this part as I encourage every single one of you to do the same.

Let’s make an impact!

I have also managed and worked closely with sales and marketing teams and even been that department for some.

Hands-on experience in the implementation of marketing strategies to include direct and indirect sales development. I am well-versed in digital marketing and the traditional marketing concepts of lead generation, advertising, and public relations. As an example, I am very capable of helping, evaluating and implementing a social media strategy. I have over 21,000 LinkedIn connections and Twitter followers, etc. Compare my social presence to any others you are interviewing.

If the rate is the only thing that prevents you from talking to me, please let's have a conversation. You should understand everything I bring to the table. Please review my Upwork Profile and the projects below the profiles for different ways we can engage to achieve your desired outcomes.

A few areas of interest:
1. Started a company with 2 file cabinets and created a 5 million dollar company in 3-years, sold it in 5-years to my largest distributor.
2. Took over a 1.6 million dollar company and left 6-years later when it was at 12 million and paid out 6 to 7-figure profits on an annual basis. 
3. Worked for a SaaS company in Precision Ag that grew 3-fold in the 18 months I was associated with it in the capacity of Business Development.
4. Worked with IT Companies, E-commerce, and other Cloud-based companies.
5. Developed and implemented workflow engagements for lead generation, support platforms (like Zen Desk) and onboarding user programs.
6. Worked with a variety of Professional Services to include Information Technology, Microsoft Partners, Real Estate, Financial, Quality, Medical, and others.

Have you asked yourself these questions: 
1. Is the product compelling to the target customer?
2. Is it easy to use? 
3. Is the product truly differentiated? Can I explain the differentiation in two minutes? 
4. Who is the competition? Why will this product succeed against them? 
5. If you have no competition, how will customers compare? What will they choose? 
6. Are the product’s strengths consistent with what’s important to the customers? Are we positioning these strengths as aggressively as possible?
7. Is the product worth the money? Why? Can customers get it cheaper elsewhere?
8. Have you made a list of the pain points or opportunities that your product solves or provides your customers? Do you know your customers?

My conversations do not center on personas, link bait, and manipulation. You don't change mindsets in an auto-responder. It is conversations about real people, moments, patterns, and opportunities. Starting this way allows the qualitative to guide the quantitative that old USA principle: Understand, Simplify, then Automate. 

Let me know if you have an interest in pursuing.

Here's how it works:

🔷First, we work together to build a brand message that resonates, connects, and converts.

🔷Then, you get your Marketing Playbook, a custom step-by-step strategy that includes everything you need to market your business, from SEO to sales funnels.

Along the way, we'll have six one-on-one strategy sessions, plus you'll get six months of weekly strategy, bonus resources, and clarity around how each section of your strategy works, why it's right for your business, and how all of the pieces fit together to create a system that makes marketing easier.

📢Clarify your message. 📢Customize your content. 📢Get a step-by-step marketing playbook

123,Google & Meta Ad Expert|10X ROAS|Strategist & Growth Partner,$55.00/hr,"I’m Keyla, and there’s a few things you should know about me:

I’m in the top 10% of Upwork Talent, with dozens of 5-star reviews
I have over a decade of experience in marketing
My clients routinely see 5x (or more!) ROI 
I’ve managed MILLIONS in ad spend, bringing businesses 6- and 7-figure profits

And I’m an Air Force veteran, which means I have the focus, drive, and adaptability to solve your problem and deliver results. 

Online marketing can be a challenge. You need someone in your corner who’s got a proven track record of providing customized, tactical solutions. Someone who can go on a full-scale online offensive and create a brand image that’s impossible to ignore. 

And if the military metaphors can’t convince you, maybe some of my happy clients can:

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “If you're considering a partnership with The Boss Level Agency, I wholeheartedly encourage you to move forward without hesitation. Our collaboration with them has been nothing short of excellent. They've driven a remarkable 93% surge in our online sales, and we're still seeing an ongoing upward trend.” 

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Hands down the best decision I ever made for my business was hiring these guys! Saw 50%ish growth in the first two months. Small price to pay for such a big outcome. Would recommend them twice if I could on here. Could not be happier!” 

Not convinced by the reviews? That’s okay, I’ve got case studies too. And these are just a small sample; you can see others on my profile:

We took an e-commerce store from “blah” to “blastoff,” increasing website traffic by 150% and doubling their sales. A technical audit to clear up website performance, a content overhaul, and a custom marketing plan helped the business soar.

We helped a plumbing company achieve an overwhelming 2100% increase in leads, while cutting their cost per lead by 85%! The company was willing to spend up to $10,000 a month on ads, but only if they saw results in an incredibly competitive field. We gave them the results they wanted and then some!

I don’t just work with businesses. Do you have a marketing agency that needs extra hands on deck for a project, or a committed partner to help you grow? I’d love to connect with you as well!

If you want explosive growth for your business and a long-term partner you can count on, you want to work with me. I take the time to listen to you and learn about your business, so that my team and I can create a marketing plan tailored to your needs. No cookie-cutter strategies here, just cutting-edge methodologies and tactics that rocket your brand to the head of the line.

Uncertainty is like a ticking time bomb for a business or an agency. When you work with me, I’ll defuse that bomb and bring clarity to your marketing strategy.

Just shoot me a message and take the first step in joining forces. Looking forward to working with you! 

To your victory,
Keyla

124,Upwork Top 1 Percent - Guaranteed Email/SMS Marketing Revenue Growth,$27.00/hr,"Want to turn your brand and product promises into powerful messages that will make your client database take action?

Want to scale your eCommerce brand but worried about increased ad costs and shrinking margins?

Well, that’s a great sign.

These days eCommerce is only getting more cut-throat, with the large brands increasing click costs with their massive budgets.

But they're also focusing on something else...

They’re all obsessed with getting more repeat purchases, because they know this is where all the profit lies.

The cost for getting a new customer is getting more expensive each and every month

But selling to them again? Well, that's damn-near free, yet really effective.

See, netting 2nd and 3rd purchases from email have very little cost, which drastically increases a brand's revenue, profit margins, and customer lifetime value.

And this is what allows them to spend more on ads, outbidding you for the same clicks since they're far more profitable.

This is how the big boys scale so quickly.

And it's precisely how I've added up to 41% extra revenue, margin, and LTV to my client's Shopify brands.

Look...back in the days of cheap, breezy FB ad clicks, email marketing was a nice-to-have.

A luxury even.

But now advanced email marketing with a tool like Klaviyo is quickly becoming a straight-up pre-requisite to even compete.

And the brands that survive the next 3 years are those that invest in nurturing long term customers today before clicks truly skyrocket.

The sobering fact is, eCommerce now is all about retention - get customers, and keep them coming back for more.

This secret alone will allow you to bullet-proof your brand's cashflow, scale fast like the big dogs, and enjoy far more take-home profits.

However, as a Klaviyo Master, I already have a loyal stable of awesome clients - so naturally, my schedule is very nearly full.

But, if we get along and I'm 100% sure I can help your unique brand, then we might be able to do some great work together.

So if you're looking for someone to help you scale with Klaviyo email marketing, click the green ""Invite To Job"" or white ""Hire Now"" button at the top right of this page.

Looking forward to discussing your project :)

PS: Here's what clients have said about my email marketing services on Upwork:

- “It was an awesome ROI and we were able to scale much, much more because of that added revenue.”

- “The margins before we started working with you was…18% and recently it was 24%…and that’s net margin.”

- “He will make you far more money than you spend with him so you’d be a dummy to not work with him.""

129,Digital Marketing Expert | Top 1 Percent Upwork | 28M in Sales,$45.00/hr,"✅ Hey! I'm Tiago Macedo, a top 1% Upwork vetted paid ads expert with over $28M in sales generated for clients across various niches. 

✅ I create ad content that stands out and drives results. My creative solutions put clients ahead of their competition and get the most out of every dollar spent. Just recently, I got a 13.43 ROAS for a cleaning robot company, making $295,000 in only 30 days.

✅ As a top 1% freelancer on Upwork, I only work with a small number of clients at a time. This lets me fully focus on each business's unique goals and challenges. If you want to grow your business and see real results, I'm here to help!

Most freelancers and agencies don't know how to create a winning creative strategy. 

They leave it up to the client to make ad content. This holds back your campaigns and wastes your time and money.

I do things differently. I put creative strategy first because I know it's the key to success. 

By making ad content that's designed for your target audience, I can get you outstanding results. Like when I made $500,000 in just 30 days for Dangle It, an e-commerce store that sells personalized car air fresheners.

⬇️ Check out some more success stories that show the power of my creative and strategic approach:

• Robot My Life (cleaning robots): $295K generated in 30 days with a 13.43 ROAS, increasing ad spend from $2,562 to $21,489
• Dangle It (car air fresheners): $500K made in 30 days, doubling ROAS and increasing ad spend from $100K to $250K
• Motiv-Art (canvas art prints): 3x more profitable in 3 months, 65% increase in sales from $34K to $97K per month
• Hard To Kill Fitness (online workout programs): 10x growth in monthly sales from $10K to $100K+
• Health Startup (at-home test strips): $300K+ generated from subscriptions, 500% increase in customer value, 257% boost in ROAS
• Watersports Clothing Brand: 2x sales, 5.18 ROAS, and expansion to new markets
• Sandia Folk (Mexican folk art): 3.44 ROAS achieved in under 60 days
• Clothing Startup (shirt collars for women): 3.33 ROAS and 60% increase in sales
• Beverages Company: $737K made with just $99K in ad spend, resulting in a 15 ROAS
• Heading Prints (book-inspired bandanas): ROAS doubled from 2.02 to 3.62 while increasing ad spend within 30 days
• Trackless Trains (high-ticket program): Leads generated at just $4 each within 30 days for a $75K+ program

As the founder of Macedo Marketing, I lead a team of experts who are dedicated to getting real results for our clients. We combine our skills in creative content, data-driven optimization, and platform-specific expertise to deliver unmatched success.

130,"Email Marketing (Klaviyo, GoHighLevel, Mailchimp) | Virtual Assistant",$10.00/hr,"Is your email marketing making noise or making money?

Let's get straight to the point: I’m the email marketing specialist who turns your inbox into a goldmine. Whether you’re in e-commerce, SaaS, real estate, or selling artisanal dog treats, my mission is simple—craft emails that don’t just sit pretty in someone’s inbox but demand attention, drive clicks, and most importantly, make your cash register sing.

I’ve been knee-deep in the email marketing world for years, juggling platforms like Klaviyo, GoHighLevel, Mailchimp, and a bunch of others you might not have heard of (but trust me, they’re game-changers). I’m not just here to talk open rates and click-throughs—I’m here to talk about how email marketing can be your silent salesperson, working 24/7 to bring in business while you sleep.

I’ve worked with businesses of all shapes and sizes, from scrappy startups to established enterprises, B2B or B2C—it doesn’t matter. What matters is understanding the psychology of your audience and crafting messages that speak directly to their needs, desires, and even their pain points. I’m all about creating that “hell yes” moment where they see your email and just have to take action.

Here’s what I bring to the table:

~ Strategic Campaigns: I design email campaigns that align with your business goals, whether that’s boosting sales, increasing engagement, or launching a new product.
~ Automation Mastery: From drip campaigns to complex workflows, I build automated systems that nurture leads, drive repeat purchases, and save you time.
~ Data-Driven Decisions: Numbers don’t lie. I analyze the heck out of your data to optimize and tweak campaigns, ensuring every email is better than the last.
~ Copy That Converts: Writing emails isn’t just about being clever; it’s about being effective. My copy doesn’t just sound good—it works.
~ Segmentation & Personalization: Not all customers are the same, and neither should your emails be. I’ll help you talk to the right people, at the right time, with the right message.

I highly recommend Jennifer and ROI Jolt to anyone looking for a great Facebook Advertising management team. I plan on working with them in the future, because I am very happy with the results we have gotten with them thus far. They put a TON of effort into messaging, creative and campaign building. They manage the campaign, the bids and creative optimizations for you. Their messaging pops and performs very well.""

🌟 ""Jennifer is highly knowledgeable and worked to understand our business so she could provide the most valuable work for us. We hired her because we didn't believe the numbers provided by our prior Facebook consultant, and Jennifer worked to discover how analytics were being miscounted and then she created and implemented a new campaign that we approved. When the actual numbers proved our prior suspicions, she didn't lie to us like our prior consultant did. She advised us to go another route. Her assistance was invaluable.""

🌟 ""Jen and the ROI Jolt team were amazing to work with! We partnered with ROI Jolt to help set up an email marketing strategy for a D2C e-commerce client. They recommended the appropriate email marketing software to accommodate our WooCommerce/WordPress website and suggested a handful of awesome automation flows and email campaigns to support the client's initiatives. From initial introductions to onboarding, set up, follow through, and project delivery - the entire process was seamless, timely, and efficient. ROI Jolt adopted the visual identity of the brand along with the voice of the brand for email copywriting quickly. I'd highly recommend Jennifer and ROI JOLT to any business that needs email marketing strategy and implementation.""

For Instagram, I have a deep understanding of the platform and its secrets to building an engaged audience. I started my own successful travel show on the platform before it became mainstream and leveraged my personal experience to help my clients achieve success. Instagram is my main specialty, and I have helped numerous businesses and individuals grow their followings and increase their brand awareness on the platform.

With Twitter, I have managed over 200 accounts and have a proven track record of building targeted followings for my clients. I use a variety of techniques to attract users who are interested in a particular industry or topic, such as writers or real estate agents. I always follow the strict rules of the platform and avoid bots and fake followers to ensure the accounts I manage have high-quality, engaged followers.

For LinkedIn, I have managed over 100 accounts and guaranteed targeted connects in each client's field while following all of the platform's rules. My love for social media drives me to give each client my very best, and I am committed to helping them achieve their social media goals.

Hello There
Thank You for taking the time to read my profile!!

Are you looking for a top-rated plus SEO specialist to get your website to the top of Google rankings (thereby increasing traffic/sales)? 

If yes, then, you have reached the right person. I am a digital marketing expert and I am here to help you, advise you, and work on your brand to achieve the results you would love. I have taken several underperforming projects in the past and converted them into successful juggernauts with some projects consistently clocking over $1 million (in sales) per month.

Apart from Search Engine Marketing, I have an expertise in:

✅Social Media Marketing & Optimization (SMM)
✅Paid advertising campaign (PPC - Google Ads, FB/Instagram ads, Bing ads, etc)
✅Content Marketing
✅WordPress Optimization
✅Shopify SEO Optimization and more

I only perform white hat SEO techniques and ensure that the brand achieves the utmost attention and generates maximum business leads. To start with I will perform an initial audit of the website to point out any optimization errors and suggest fixes for the same. This takes around a couple of hours. After the initial findings, we can work upon:

✅Keyword Research
✅On-Page SEO (including Meta Tags optimization, Page Speed issues, crawling issues, HTTP redirect errors, ALT Tags issues, and more)
✅Link Building activities (includes Social Bookmarking, Classified Ads, Profile Creation, Blog Submission/Promotion, and more)
✅Social media engagement to increase subscribers, likes, views, etc

For social media marketing, more engagement with followers and an increase in followers would be the first priority. This will be done through daily posts and constant engagement with the audience. We can utilize a like-4-like strategy, use hashtags to target local users, and more.

For paid advertising, I will set up your campaign (on Google, Instagram, or any other channel) and monitor it over the period to generate maximum ROAS. 

“P.S. I will provide you with the content and help with the creative as well.”

With a track record of delighting clients and achieving outstanding results, I'm eager to become your strategic partner in driving growth and engagement.

My approach is simple yet effective: I prioritize your goals and tailor strategies that resonate with your unique brand identity. 

I'm selective in collaborations, favoring partners committed to shared success. Please note, I typically engage in medium to long-term projects and may decline other commitments that involve:

❌ Micromanagement and unattainably high demands.
❌ Immediate results from Facebook Ads without acknowledging the process.
❌ Expect me to respond to your messages every 5 minutes or less.
❌ Short-term, one-off tasks like pixel setup and error troubleshooting.

I take pride in fostering positive, collaborative relationships and going the extra mile to ensure that your needs are met and exceeded. 

My commitment to client satisfaction goes beyond strategy – I take pride in cultivating collaborative relationships and exceeding expectations.

I am here to provide transparent communication, timely updates, and strategic insights that keep you informed every step of the way.

So you're ready to invest in high quality, authoritative backlinks that help you rank #1 huh?

The struggle is real...

You've built your website. You've spent hours tirelessly writing the content. But you're still not getting any Google love!

IF YOU’RE TIRED OF NOT GETTING ANY TRAFFIC…

Then repeat after me:

“The ‘publish and pray’ method does NOT work.”

If you’re not building backlinks, you’re going to struggle to get search engine traffic.

There are over 200 ranking factors and link building is still the #1 determining factor. 

In fact, if you do nothing else and ONLY focus on links, you have a better chance at building a high-traffic blog than if you were to do everything BUT link building.

I actually focus on building high quality backlinks with something called the ‘Skyscraper Technique’.

Here's what I do:

1) I find similar articles in your niche with lots of links

2) I create a list of everyone who linked to that similar article and their email address 

3) You (or your team) will write the article and I'll support you in ensuring it becomes a highly linkable asset.

4) I reach out to every prospect from step 2 and say something along the lines of 'hey - great website, love the article you've linked to - and I've created a similar article here...you may want to link to it'

Sound good? Well hold your horses...

Before you send me an offer—as many people do every week—you need to know something: I am CRAZY busy.

So here's the catch:

If your budget is less than a minimum of $1,000 per month—I’ll decline it.

And if you don't truly understand the value of link building and the returns it brings, I’ll decline it.

This isn't a marketing ploy. And it's not that I'm trying to be rude. 

It's just that if you become my client, you get my absolute best... and right now I'm working serious overtime, helping my clients to grow their websites and generate that sweet Google love.

My Approach: Your Customer Comes First

Here’s the truth I’ve learned after over a decade in copywriting: your copy shouldn’t just be about what you do—it should be about what your customer needs. I dig deep into who you’re targeting, what they struggle with, and how you can make their lives better. Then, I use storytelling, strong CTAs, and a natural, relatable tone to turn those insights into copy that gets results.

Whether it’s an email sequence that boosts your open rates, a lead magnet that fills your sales funnel, or web copy that turns clicks into conversions, I’ve got you covered.

Some results I’ve helped clients achieve:

📑 Lead Magnets
📑 Email Newsletters
📑 Website Copywriting
📑 Blog Writing

I start every project by asking a lot of questions—I want to understand your business inside and out. Then, I’ll take that knowledge and craft content that doesn’t just sound good, but actually drives action. Plus, I keep the process collaborative, communicative, and (dare I say) fun!
