99,Graphic Designer | Logo Design & Visual Identity Designer,$50.00/hr,"Hello there!

As an expert visual artist and graphic designer with 7+ years of experience, I can make your brand stand out and get noticed. Good design stands at the crossroads of function and beauty. It engages, compels, and makes perfect sense. This is what I strive to give my clients.

I believe good branding is more than creating eye-appealing visual. It should also display the brand personality and speak to the audience on an emotional level. It is the key to communicate your message to the target audience effectively. 

My process aims to unearth and communicate the intangible essence of a brand that people fall in love with. From its behaviour to its products; I believe every company has a story to tell and that design can be the most powerful way to tell it.

Brand identity design is the special sauce that can help your business to differentiate from others. Let’s cook it together. I develop a brand language and design system to express your brand powerfully. I create the foundations of your visual identity: from logo and colour palette through to bespoke typography and imagery.

Whether you’re a larger organization, small company or an individual, I treat every project with the same high degree of ambition and attention to detail with fast turnaround time and effective communication. I have the agility and creativity to meet challenges of all sizes.

141,Experienced Graphic Designer and Illustrator | Brand Identity Expert,$25.00/hr,"I see you need a logo…not a trivial one, copied from photo stocks, but a nice outstanding logo, an original one, that makes your brand unique and strong. Well, you came to the right place! I’ve got a superpower: I will develop a representative logo that will emphasize your brand’s strengths. In 7 years of practicing design magic, I mastered the Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects spells to deliver you a high-quality modern, and relevant brand identity. My designs are a mixture of creativity and collaboration with clients, and I move heaven and earth to see them happy and satisfied, so each time they look at their logo they relish it.

While creating a logotype I try my best to make it clear (almost minimalistic) and fill it with sense so the message translated by the brand is understandable and transparent. Every logo I make is a new experience, a challenging adventure for me no matter whether I'm working for a big corporation or a small studio, or a personal brand.

The biggest part of my portfolio is dedicated to Upgrade Academy - an educational institution for kids and teenagers. I contributed to this project as a brand and identity developer also created printables and Social Media visual content. My client's mission was to develop a friendly, transparent, modern brand associated with kids and teen education. We used bright, contrasting colors and a minimalistic style to make the brand look modern and bold. The next brand I developed a design for is Ride Safe - an application and also a social project dedicated to bikers and those who want to ride their motorcycles safely and consciously. Then goes a logo for VoodaLab - a software development company focused on creating mobile apps. The client wanted the logo to be not so serious, something funny and observable. After this I was invited to create the logotype for a social initiative called PECS kids, it works with autistic children and my mission was to combine in the logo the care for children and the puzzle - the official symbol of autism. The client liked the most second logo design. After this, I participated in a project that it's still in development. It's a messenger for people who want to spend their Friday evening in good company with some good drinks :) The client’s wish was --combining the night city landscape and the bar/party theme so we’ve got a cool modern and a bit romantic logo for the product.

💬 “I hired Nadejda to create a brand identity for my company. I was pleased by the results. And after that, she created a nice logo for our Android application and helped a lot with the application UI.
I definitely recommend her as a valuable specialist.” - Denis E. VoodaLab CEO

💬 “I wonder how Nadejda finds so quickly the inspiration for her logos. You just give her a task and the next day you have 3 different logo ideas to choose from. ” - Adelina, Fishka Dance Studio founder

💬 “Her logos are minimalistic, simple, and they describe well the brand essence and values. ” - Helen H, Upgrade Academy PR manager

My main specialization is brand identity development, including logo creation, designing brand books, and rebranding, but I’m also open to participating in projects as a vector illustrator, editorial designer, or photo editor.

If you decide to work with me, you will be guaranteed to receive the files in all needed formats - PNG, ESP, AI, JPEG. Also, you will receive colorful and realistic mockups with your logo to see how you can use it in real life. Creating a visual identity I develop a color and typographic guide that can be implemented in your app or website. 

I’m always seeking to obtain the best possible result, that's why I'm online and available for the biggest part of the day. The work will be delivered on time and you won’t have to worry and ask me if the work’s going or not. I will let you know about the work progress as soon as possible. I’m very responsible and adaptive to client’s needs and wishes, that’s why your every word will be taken into consideration.
