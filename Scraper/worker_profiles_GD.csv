‚ñ∫ I‚Äôve successfully cooperated with publishing house Trans Tech Publications Ltd.(Switzerland). The evidence of success is that I started with the simple help of authors, and now I am running huge projects for important clients such as the International Symposium on Ultra Clean Processing of Semiconductor Surfaces and the international conference Thermec. My assistance as a project support manager helps the working process on a book publication go smoothly and faster for editors and other participants. One of my tasks was to make a business presentation and a short video for Thermec in compliance with a laconic corporate style, depicting main streams and peculiarities. It helped to show the client's importance and led to multiple entrusting research works by participants. More than 600 participants had a chance to watch it

‚ñ∫Also, I cooperate on a regular basis with nutritionist and health coach Darina. I created a sales funnel in ManyChat that brought her over 841 new subscribers to her Telegram channel within 3 days. One of the advertising campaigns (texts, creatives, video, setting the targeted ads, collecting leads, making analysis) I set up for her resulted in 5 leads within 7 hours. 3 of them joined the event, and Darina got $396 while spending only $13 on advertising.

‚ô• ‚ÄúMy 7-year cooperation with Natalia speaks louder than words. She started with administrating my education process, and now we continue co-working in social media designing and marketing. She is a reliable, responsible, and high-quality-oriented specialist. I recommend her to every person who is seeking an expert and also who wants to sleep calmly when the task is on.‚Äù - Darina, health coach

‚ñ∫ I made editing, proofreading and translation of a scientific articles for Andrey K. | Managing Editor of the scientific journal. The articles were successfully accepted for publication in Scopus-indexed journals. 

‚ô• ‚ÄúI hired Natalia to do some editing and professional reading for our publishing house, as well as some translation services. They demonstrated excellent communication skills, high-quality results and surprisingly high productivity. I have never seen such a qualified person. It was very pleasant and comfortable to cooperate. Highly recommend!""

As an expert visual artist and graphic designer with 7+ years of experience, I can make your brand stand out and get noticed. Good design stands at the crossroads of function and beauty. It engages, compels, and makes perfect sense. This is what I strive to give my clients.

I believe good branding is more than creating eye-appealing visual. It should also display the brand personality and speak to the audience on an emotional level. It is the key to communicate your message to the target audience effectively. 

My process aims to unearth and communicate the intangible essence of a brand that people fall in love with. From its behaviour to its products; I believe every company has a story to tell and that design can be the most powerful way to tell it.

Brand identity design is the special sauce that can help your business to differentiate from others. Let‚Äôs cook it together. I develop a brand language and design system to express your brand powerfully.

141,Experienced Graphic Designer and Illustrator | Brand Identity Expert,$25.00/hr,"I see you need a logo‚Ä¶not a trivial one, copied from photo stocks, but a nice outstanding logo, an original one, that makes your brand unique and strong. Well, you came to the right place! I‚Äôve got a superpower: I will develop a representative logo that will emphasize your brand‚Äôs strengths. In 7 years of practicing design magic, I mastered the Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects spells to deliver you a high-quality modern, and relevant brand identity. My designs are a mixture of creativity and collaboration with clients, and I move heaven and earth to see them happy and satisfied, so each time they look at their logo they relish it.

While creating a logotype I try my best to make it clear (almost minimalistic) and fill it with sense so the message translated by the brand is understandable and transparent. Every logo I make is a new experience, a challenging adventure for me no matter whether I'm working for a big corporation or a small studio, or a personal brand.

The biggest part of my portfolio is dedicated to Upgrade Academy - an educational institution for kids and teenagers. I contributed to this project as a brand and identity developer also created printables and Social Media visual content. My client's mission was to develop a friendly, transparent, modern brand associated with kids and teen education. We used bright, contrasting colors and a minimalistic style to make the brand look modern and bold. The next brand I developed a design for is Ride Safe - an application and also a social project dedicated to bikers and those who want to ride their motorcycles safely and consciously. Then goes a logo for VoodaLab - a software development company focused on creating mobile apps. The client wanted the logo to be not so serious, something funny and observable. After this I was invited to create the logotype for a social initiative called PECS kids, it works with autistic children and my mission was to combine in the logo the care for children and the puzzle - the official symbol of autism. The client liked the most second logo design. After this, I participated in a project that it's still in development. It's a messenger for people who want to spend their Friday evening in good company with some good drinks :) The client‚Äôs wish was --combining the night city landscape and the bar/party theme so we‚Äôve got a cool modern and a bit romantic logo for the product.

üí¨ ‚ÄúI hired Nadejda to create a brand identity for my company. I was pleased by the results. And after that, she created a nice logo for our Android application and helped a lot with the application UI.
I definitely recommend her as a valuable specialist.‚Äù - Denis E. VoodaLab CEO

üí¨ ‚ÄúI wonder how Nadejda finds so quickly the inspiration for her logos. You just give her a task and the next day you have 3 different logo ideas to choose from. ‚Äù - Adelina, Fishka Dance Studio founder

üí¨ ‚ÄúHer logos are minimalistic, simple, and they describe well the brand essence and values. ‚Äù - Helen H, Upgrade Academy PR manager

My main specialization is brand identity development, including logo creation, designing brand books, and rebranding, but I‚Äôm also open to participating in projects as a vector illustrator, editorial designer, or photo editor.

If you decide to work with me, you will be guaranteed to receive the files in all needed formats - PNG, ESP, AI, JPEG. Also, you will receive colorful and realistic mockups with your logo to see how you can use it in real life. Creating a visual identity I develop a color and typographic guide that can be implemented in your app or website. 

I‚Äôm always seeking to obtain the best possible result, that's why I'm online and available for the biggest part of the day. The work will be delivered on time and you won‚Äôt have to worry and ask me if the work‚Äôs going or not. I will let you know about the work progress as soon as possible.
