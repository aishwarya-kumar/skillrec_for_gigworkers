I did a PhD at Stony Brook University, where I conducted quantitative research in political psychology and political economics and where I received extensive training in statistics and methods of data analysis. My coursework included basic statistics and probability, experiment design, econometrics, linear and non-linear regression models (including binomial models, multinomial models, ordinal models, count models, censored and truncated models), maximum-likelihood estimation, time-series analysis, experiment design, causal inference, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, structural equation modeling, factor analysis, game theory, computational modeling and simulations.

For several years I also taught university courses in math, statistics, and quantitative research methods for social science. I taught students how to use R, Stata, and Excel for data analysis. I taught both undergraduate students and doctoral students. 

I also have experience with publishing quantitative research in a peer-reviewed journal as a solo author.

In my freelance consulting work, I have advised clients on study design and statistical analysis for projects in many different fields of research, including psychology, sociology, economics, linguistics, mental health, medical treatment and recovery, business hiring practices, predictive modeling of asset prices, consumer preferences for market research, and others.

If you're interested in hiring me for a project, you should message me directly rather than invite me to apply for a job.
