12,Data Scientist | Google Analytics | HubSpot | Domo,$125.00/hr,"I am a data scientist who specializes in digital marketing analytics, Google Analytics 4 / Google Tag Manager, and customer behavioral analysis. 

I work primarily with e-commerce brands and B2Bs, but I also work with businesses in industries such as legal and professional services and real estate as well. 

I've recently completed GA4 projects for clients such as Vista Equity Partners, NASCAR, USAA, and AARP.

Web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager, play an indispensable role in today's business landscape. 

By tracking and analyzing user behavior, interaction patterns, and key performance indicators, these tools provide actionable insights that can drive decision-making and strategic planning. 

Understanding where visitors come from, what content they engage with, how they navigate through a site, and at what point they might leave, can uncover areas for optimization, allowing businesses to refine their marketing strategies, improve user experience, and increase conversion rates. 

Additionally, with real-time reporting, organizations can respond to trends quickly, adapting to market changes and maintaining a competitive edge. In an age where data-driven decisions are paramount to success, the investment in web analytics tools can often translate into increased revenue, customer retention, and overall business growth.

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) offers a host of advanced features and integrations that can provide valuable business intelligence to drive revenue. Here's how:

1. **Real-Time Data Analysis**: GA4's real-time reporting enables businesses to respond to trends and customer behaviors as they happen. This allows for immediate adjustments to marketing strategies or website content, ensuring optimal engagement and conversion.

2. **Audience Segmentation**: By understanding the different segments of an audience, businesses can create targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with specific groups. GA4's audience segmentation tools help identify these segments based on behavior, demographics, and interests, allowing for more personalized and effective marketing.

3. **Cross-Platform Tracking**: GA4's ability to track users across different devices and platforms gives a more holistic view of the customer journey. This can reveal insights into how different touchpoints influence purchasing decisions, enabling a more coordinated and efficient marketing approach.

4. **Predictive Metrics**: GA4 uses machine learning to offer predictive metrics, such as potential revenue from particular audience segments. This helps businesses to focus their efforts on the most promising areas, optimizing their return on investment.

5. **Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking**: By closely monitoring how users interact with products on a website, GA4 provides insights into which products are most appealing, the effectiveness of product recommendations, shopping cart abandonment rates, and more. This information is vital for optimizing product placement, pricing strategies, and overall ecommerce effectiveness.

6. **Integration with Advertising Platforms**: GA4's seamless integration with various advertising platforms, like Google Ads, means that businesses can manage and measure their advertising efforts within a unified environment. This ensures more precise targeting and measurement, driving a more efficient use of advertising budget.

7. **Custom Reporting and Dashboards**: GA4 allows for customized reporting that aligns with specific business goals and KPIs. This flexibility ensures that businesses have ready access to the most relevant data, empowering them to make informed decisions that align with their revenue-driving objectives.

8. **Compliance and Data Privacy**: With increased concerns over data privacy, GA4 has features to help businesses comply with regulations like GDPR. By maintaining compliance, businesses reduce the risk of legal issues that could impact revenue and reputation.

9. **Event Tracking and Automation**: GA4's event tracking capabilities allow businesses to understand user interactions at a granular level, such as clicks on specific buttons or form submissions. These insights can lead to the automation of specific responses, further optimizing user engagement and conversion pathways.

By leveraging these features, businesses can extract actionable insights, refine their strategies, and make data-driven decisions that align with their goals, ultimately leading to increased revenue.",338,"7,824",Carbondale,,100,"['Domo and Hubspot Developer', 'Web Analytics | GA4 | Segment | Domo | Google Tag Manager | Rev Ops', 'Review and optimize GTM - check and fix GA and Facebook and check all conversion tracking', 'looking for analytics setup measuring revenue related to SEO services', '60 minute consultation', 'Domo', '30 minute consultation', '30 minute consultation', '30 minute consultation', 'Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Google Tag Manager Audit and Ecommerce Tracking Implementation', 'Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager Troubleshooting Expert Needed', 'E-commerce Business Data Analyst', 'Senior Data Analyst - Churn (Metabase Experience Required)', 'Pull Information from Google Adwords & S3 to LookerStudio', 'Google Analytics 4 and Google Big Query expert']","['Data Analysis', 'Google Ads', 'Search Engine Optimization', 'Data Science', 'Data Modeling', 'Facebook Ads Manager', 'Data Visualization', 'Domo', 'Looker Studio', 'Data Mining', 'Paid Media', 'Machine Learning', 'Data Cleaning']"

Examples of deliverable:
🔸One of my customers faced the challenge of optimizing its procurement strategy to maximize savings while managing stock levels. The company sources products from multiple suppliers, each offering various price breaks and conditions for free shipping based on minimum order quantities. Using mixed integer programming (MIP), we aimed to determine the optimal order quantities from each supplier that not only satisfy inventory requirements but also minimize overall purchasing costs. This MIP model involves defining decision variables for the quantity ordered from each supplier, constraints to maintain stock levels within specific limits, and an objective function that minimizes the total cost, including adjustments for suppliers' discounts and shipping costs. By implementing this solution, my customer saves thousands of dollars each week by optimizing their purchases.

🔸Designing and building custom forecast models for planning future demand and aligning resources accordingly. These models leverage advanced analytics to predict demand patterns accurately, enabling efficient resource allocation. From sales forecasting to inventory management, customized models empower businesses to stay agile and responsive to market fluctuations, ensuring optimal operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

🔸Developed propensity models in Jupyter notebooks to predict lead conversion likelihood, enabling prioritization of leads that align with business objectives and optimize ROI. The models were seamlessly integrated into production on a SQL server.

🔸Created a price simulation tool to estimate the impact of various input parameters on profitability, accounting for non-linear effects such as churn rate based on margin and marketing cost to expand the customer base.

🔸 Implemented price optimization models to maximize revenue or profit, collaborating closely with sales and marketing teams to align with business objectives and revenue management rules.

🔸 Designed a customized optimization process to find the value of the parameters maximizing a business outcome within constraints.

With 8 years of experience in Python and AI, and a PhD to back it up, I’ve worked with leading AI companies like Turing, OpenAI, and Reddit. As the founder of 5 AI companies operating across Taiwan, Germany, USA, and Pakistan, I’ve tackled a wide range of challenges in the AI landscape. You could say I'm an ""AI Guy,"" and I bring that expertise to every project I take on.

We’ll be a great fit if you need:

“I have a breakthrough idea and need an expert who truly gets AI”
“My industry is facing a complex problem, and I need a custom AI solution”
“I need a few critical features completed to secure our next funding round”
“We’re tired of off-the-shelf solutions and want to build something proprietary”
You’re dealing with inconsistent quality, rising costs, or unreliable partners
When you work with me, you’ll get: 

👉 Clean, scalable AI solutions built to handle exponential growth without a single hiccup
👉 Transparent, top-tier communication with constant feedback and updates
👉 On-time, on-budget delivery – 90%+ of my projects hit their marks, and so will yours
👉 Realistic expectations – I’ll tell you if something can’t be done within your timeline or budget
👉 A full refund if I over-promise or under-deliver. No hassle, no hard feelings
👉 Strategic, product-focused development to ensure every decision is backed by data

Clients love saying things like: 

⚡️ “It is always a great pleasure working with Muhammad and his team . They are very professional and transparent , great communication too”
⚡️ “Great experience. Attention to detail. Very responsive. Honest work with his team. Will definitely recommend”
⚡️ “Muhammad is an honest and transparent professional from Pakistan who exceeded my expectation to deliver a very technical AI project. He has access to a pool of talented scientists and quant analysts who work with full dedication. Definitely, recommended.”
⚡️ “Muhammad was amazing. He took a very difficult implementation and made a miracle in record time. He's the best I've worked it. I'm very happy with the results”

However, we might not be the best fit if: 

❌ Your project hinges solely on cutting costs
❌ You need an overnight turnaround – good AI takes time to build right
❌ Your project involves betting, adult entertainment, or questionable ethics
❌ You don’t value mutual respect and clear communication
