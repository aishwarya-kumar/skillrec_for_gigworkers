"Data scientist, machine learning expert, Python developer.",$99.00/hr,"I enjoy applying predictive modeling and machine learning to deliver value for my clients, assisting them with decision-making and automating their tasks intelligently. I was the winner of the USA Electricity Prices Prediction contest, held among four qualified Upwork data scientists. Through numerous experiments, I've developed expertise in often-overlooked ML techniques such as feature selection, ensembling, calibration, and hyperparameter tuning, where I’m developing novel approaches for my upcoming AutoML library, Diogenes.

These days, my work primarily focuses on tabular machine learning tasks within the Python ecosystem [scikit-learn, gradient-boosted trees, PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow]. I have experience with various software but currently prefer PostgreSQL for data storage, Plotly and Seaborn for data visualization, and Dash for dashboarding. For efficiency, I use Numba to accelerate my Python code and Dask to handle large computations across clusters when single-machine multiprocessing isn't enough.

I prioritize code quality and continuously work to adopt best practices in my development process. While it's not perfect yet, I’m committed to improvement. In my free time, I contribute to open-source projects and explore ML applications in finance and trading.

                        What I can do for you: 

⭐️ generate ideas to optimize your business (pricing, customer engagement, ads and many more)
⭐️ build real-time decision support systems that take into consideration many factors and execute optimal actions
⭐️ train predictive models for your business needs (sales, churn, uplift, next-best-action, propensity)

⭐️ build modern AI integrations (OpenAI's ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude etc)
⭐️ produce professional reports & dashboards, generate insights from your data

Top Rated | Certified Google Ads & SEO Expert | 10 Years Experience,$20.00/hr,"Firstly, I'm an native English Speaker... This removes 90% of frustrations that people experience when hiring freelancers.. You can be rest assured your business is being marketed online as it should be... PERFECTLY AND PROFESSIONALLY. 

Secondly, take a look at the video on my profile (on the left 👀) called "" How To Not Hire The Wrong Freelancer On Upwork"" ..... that video will help you in the following ways:

✅It will ensure you don’t make the mistake of talking to a fake profile or, worse, hiring the wrong person, saving you from wasting months of your life and blowing your budget.
✅If I’m not a good fit for your job,  I’ll make sure to introduce you to someone good and trusted who can help. You can’t lose—I know who’s real and who’s not on Upwork, and I know who’s good and who’s not.
✅You’ll get a free audit or market analysis to see if your current Google Ads can be improved, OR if you should even be doing Google Ads in the first place 
✅I’ll also take a look at your website and highlight what needs improvement

Upwork Top Rated Certified Google Ads (Search Engine Marketing) - Bing Ads - SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Specialist with a 100% Upwork Job Success score, over 133 ★★★★★ reviews on completed jobs, and over 53 case studies of happy clients in my Upwork Portfolio section.

Do you want to have this part of your business finally 100% handled so you can focus on other things?

★★★★★ - Laura Y - Shopbettermortgages | ""Darren is an exceptional Google Ads professional. I highly recommend him to anyone that's looking for a Google Ads expert.""

✅ Successfully managed Google ads for more than 75 unique industries:
✅ Client Reviews: I focus on providing VALUE to all of my Clients
✅ Over-Delivering: I take pride in leaving all of my Clients saying ""WOW
✅ Responsiveness: Being extremely responsive
✅ Kindness: Treating everyone with respect, understanding all situations, and genuinely wanting to IMPROVE my Client's situations.

Are you tired of working with unreliable freelancers who are big on promises but never really deliver?

You've probably noticed that most freelancers/ agencies will promise that they can do whatever you want, designed to take your money for as long as they can get away with it:

💸 Facebook ads
💸 Email marketing
💸 Copywriting
💸 Walking your dog 🐕

The list is endless and so are their excuses when they don't deliver quality results.

This is whats known in the industry as 'running a client through the mill'. Don't fall for it.

I DO NOT take on clients if I'm not confident i can generate leads for their business. It’s simply not something that I do.

Working with me means no more fluff, no more empty promises, no more missed delivery dates…

A lot of businesses come to me asking for my help with Google Ads but I don’t take the majority on as clients because Google ads are not suitable for every business.

Most freelancers won't tell you that though, they will take your money for as long as they can, they will promise that the results you want are ""just around the corner"", or ""Next month you will have profit from your ads""

Sound familiar? I've been there myself, lost a lot of time and money... (sniffle) 😔

I take the time to learn about your business.

It's for this reason that I will only take on new clients (maximum 1 per month) who I'm confident I can get results for and have long lasting business relationships with.

Save yourself years of trouble and money, and let's have a chat to see if Google Ads could actually make money for your business..

Invite me to your job or send me a message and I will point you in the right direction if Google Ads are not what you need.

If we establish that Google ads could potentially work for you, then and only then will we can talk about working together and creating a campaign that will put your ads far ahead of your competitors and tap into their profits.

Unless you hire a Google Ads specific expert who knows what they are doing with your money… You are going to continue to lose it..

So what now?

If you've read to this point, and I appreciate that, I'd love to hear about what exactly you need help with.

☎️____________ MESSAGE ME ____________☎️
**GET 30 MINUTE STRATEGY CONSULTATION**

I've learned that, while there may be similarities between my clients, each one is a unique company with its own unique business needs and goals.

Please send me a message and tell me a bit about your situation and what you're trying to accomplish.

Then I'll help you come up with a plan for tackling your unique project .

If the rate is the only thing that prevents you from talking to me, please let's have a conversation. You should understand everything I bring to the table. Please review my Upwork Profile and the projects below the profiles for different ways we can engage to achieve your desired outcomes.

A few areas of interest:
1. Started a company with 2 file cabinets and created a 5 million dollar company in 3-years, sold it in 5-years to my largest distributor.
2. Took over a 1.6 million dollar company and left 6-years later when it was at 12 million and paid out 6 to 7-figure profits on an annual basis. 
3. Worked for a SaaS company in Precision Ag that grew 3-fold in the 18 months I was associated with it in the capacity of Business Development.
4. Worked with IT Companies, E-commerce, and other Cloud-based companies.
5. Developed and implemented workflow engagements for lead generation, support platforms (like Zen Desk) and onboarding user programs.
6. Worked with a variety of Professional Services to include Information Technology, Microsoft Partners, Real Estate, Financial, Quality, Medical, and others.

Have you asked yourself these questions: 
1. Is the product compelling to the target customer?
2. Is it easy to use? 
3. Is the product truly differentiated? Can I explain the differentiation in two minutes? 
4. Who is the competition? Why will this product succeed against them? 
5. If you have no competition, how will customers compare? What will they choose? 
6. Are the product’s strengths consistent with what’s important to the customers? Are we positioning these strengths as aggressively as possible?
7. Is the product worth the money? Why? Can customers get it cheaper elsewhere?
8. Have you made a list of the pain points or opportunities that your product solves or provides your customers? Do you know your customers?

My conversations do not center on personas, link bait, and manipulation. You don't change mindsets in an auto-responder. It is conversations about real people, moments, patterns, and opportunities. Starting this way allows the qualitative to guide the quantitative that old USA principle: Understand, Simplify, then Automate.

Digital Marketing Manager | SEO Expert | FB and Instagram Ad Campaign,$20.00/hr,"**Upwork's Top Rated Plus Digital Marketing Expert - Top 3% on Upwork**

Hello There
Thank You for taking the time to read my profile!!

Are you looking for a top-rated plus SEO specialist to get your website to the top of Google rankings (thereby increasing traffic/sales)? 

If yes, then, you have reached the right person. I am a digital marketing expert and I am here to help you, advise you, and work on your brand to achieve the results you would love. I have taken several underperforming projects in the past and converted them into successful juggernauts with some projects consistently clocking over $1 million (in sales) per month.

Apart from Search Engine Marketing, I have an expertise in:

✅Social Media Marketing & Optimization (SMM)
✅Paid advertising campaign (PPC - Google Ads, FB/Instagram ads, Bing ads, etc)
✅Content Marketing
✅WordPress Optimization
✅Shopify SEO Optimization and more

I only perform white hat SEO techniques and ensure that the brand achieves the utmost attention and generates maximum business leads. To start with I will perform an initial audit of the website to point out any optimization errors and suggest fixes for the same. This takes around a couple of hours. After the initial findings, we can work upon:

✅Keyword Research
✅On-Page SEO (including Meta Tags optimization, Page Speed issues, crawling issues, HTTP redirect errors, ALT Tags issues, and more)
✅Link Building activities (includes Social Bookmarking, Classified Ads, Profile Creation, Blog Submission/Promotion, and more)
✅Social media engagement to increase subscribers, likes, views, etc

For social media marketing, more engagement with followers and an increase in followers would be the first priority. This will be done through daily posts and constant engagement with the audience. We can utilize a like-4-like strategy, use hashtags to target local users, and more.

For paid advertising, I will set up your campaign (on Google, Instagram, or any other channel) and monitor it over the period to generate maximum ROAS. 

“P.S. I will provide you with the content and help with the creative as well.”

"Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn Social Media Marketing Expert",$3.33/hr,"Social Media Manager:

I am a social media manager expert specifically for Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Let tell you a bit of my experience with these sites. 

*Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn:

Instagram:
This is truly were my love and passion for social media truly started. It all started in 2012. I discovered an app lying around the app store and installed it. The app was called Instagram. At this time, Instagram still wasn't known nor was there a boom of bloggers and influencers. This is where I trult shined I was one of the very first ones to go and create my very own live travel show called ""thehappysolotraveler."" It was an instant hit! From zero I had ended up thousands of followers! Before I knew it, I actually became a local online celebrity in my own country, The Philippines. I was a hit! It was from there I learned all the basics and techniques of social media alone. My very personal account opened my eyes to social media and its secrets as a whole. To the point I finally ventured in lending my talent and gift at Instagram to my clients. From there on, everything just went smooth sailing. I love Instagram. My main specialty indeed for the social media world. 

Twitter:
I managed over 100+ Twitter accounts for my clients here in Upwork and was able to truly build their handle with that targeted potential audience that definitely met the client's field. So for example you're a author, I can target you people whom I feel can truly relate to what you have to offer and share in the social media world. I'll target perhaps writers, book lovers, etc. If you're a real estate agent or real estate ghost writer, I can target you local people in your area, realtors, home seekers, etc. I always see to it that my very best is given  and to make sure I build following all the strict rules of the site and avoid bots and fake followers as a whole.

LinkedIn:
I managed over 70+ LinkedIn accounts for my clients here in Upwork. I guarantee you potential targeted connects in your field as well following all the rules of the site. Social media is my love and I see to it that I always give it my very best for each and every client I get a chance to work with.","1,984","84,689",Bacolod,Philippines,97,"['Instagram Organic Growth', 'Social media manager', 'We need an Instagram expert to grow the number if followers', 'Instagram Account Marketing', 'Instagram Engagement Management', 'Instagram growth', 'Social Media Engagement Specialist', 'LinkedIn targeted growth', 'Instagram growth  strategy', 'Twitter Growth', 'Social media - Instagram', 'Growth Hacker - Social Media', 'social media growth', 'Instagram account manager', 'Instagram Growth Manager', 'Instagram Growth Specialist Needed', 'Weekly growth for 2 Instagram and 1 Linkedin Accounts', 'Growing X Account to 25k followers', 'Social growth manager', 'Linkedin marketing and growth']","['Social Media Management', 'Social Media Marketing', 'Instagram', 'Twitter/X', 'Twitter/X Marketing', 'LinkedIn Development']"

✅ I create ad content that stands out and drives results. My creative solutions put clients ahead of their competition and get the most out of every dollar spent. Just recently, I got a 13.43 ROAS for a cleaning robot company, making $295,000 in only 30 days.

✅ As a top 1% freelancer on Upwork, I only work with a small number of clients at a time. This lets me fully focus on each business's unique goals and challenges. If you want to grow your business and see real results, I'm here to help!

Most freelancers and agencies don't know how to create a winning creative strategy. 

They leave it up to the client to make ad content. This holds back your campaigns and wastes your time and money.

I do things differently. I put creative strategy first because I know it's the key to success. 

By making ad content that's designed for your target audience, I can get you outstanding results. Like when I made $500,000 in just 30 days for Dangle It, an e-commerce store that sells personalized car air fresheners.

⬇️ Check out some more success stories that show the power of my creative and strategic approach:

• Robot My Life (cleaning robots): $295K generated in 30 days with a 13.43 ROAS, increasing ad spend from $2,562 to $21,489
• Dangle It (car air fresheners): $500K made in 30 days, doubling ROAS and increasing ad spend from $100K to $250K
• Motiv-Art (canvas art prints): 3x more profitable in 3 months, 65% increase in sales from $34K to $97K per month
• Hard To Kill Fitness (online workout programs): 10x growth in monthly sales from $10K to $100K+
• Health Startup (at-home test strips): $300K+ generated from subscriptions, 500% increase in customer value, 257% boost in ROAS
• Watersports Clothing Brand: 2x sales, 5.18 ROAS, and expansion to new markets
• Sandia Folk (Mexican folk art): 3.44 ROAS achieved in under 60 days
• Clothing Startup (shirt collars for women): 3.33 ROAS and 60% increase in sales
• Beverages Company: $737K made with just $99K in ad spend, resulting in a 15 ROAS

Examples of deliverable:
🔸One of my customers faced the challenge of optimizing its procurement strategy to maximize savings while managing stock levels. The company sources products from multiple suppliers, each offering various price breaks and conditions for free shipping based on minimum order quantities. Using mixed integer programming (MIP), we aimed to determine the optimal order quantities from each supplier that not only satisfy inventory requirements but also minimize overall purchasing costs. This MIP model involves defining decision variables for the quantity ordered from each supplier, constraints to maintain stock levels within specific limits, and an objective function that minimizes the total cost, including adjustments for suppliers' discounts and shipping costs. By implementing this solution, my customer saves thousands of dollars each week by optimizing their purchases.

🔸Designing and building custom forecast models for planning future demand and aligning resources accordingly. These models leverage advanced analytics to predict demand patterns accurately, enabling efficient resource allocation. From sales forecasting to inventory management, customized models empower businesses to stay agile and responsive to market fluctuations, ensuring optimal operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

🔸Developed propensity models in Jupyter notebooks to predict lead conversion likelihood, enabling prioritization of leads that align with business objectives and optimize ROI. The models were seamlessly integrated into production on a SQL server.

🔸Created a price simulation tool to estimate the impact of various input parameters on profitability, accounting for non-linear effects such as churn rate based on margin and marketing cost to expand the customer base.

🔸 Implemented price optimization models to maximize revenue or profit, collaborating closely with sales and marketing teams to align with business objectives and revenue management rules.

🔸 Designed a customized optimization process to find the value of the parameters maximizing a business outcome within constraints.

🔸Generated synthetic tabular data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the ctgan library. Designed a custom cost function to produce synthetic records that adhere to specific criteria, including distribution functions and goal metrics.",19,249,Toronto,Canada,100,"['Price Model Development [Python]', 'Paid job interview for mathematician/statistician for bespoke forecasting', 'Participate in an Academic Survey to Reflect on your Freelancing Experience – DR72', 'Help with Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and other tests on my dataset.', 'Seeking Data Scientists/Data Engineers with ETL, ML, Python and AWS experience [aws-gsml-2023-1]', 'Software developers with GDPR/CCPA experience or with handling user data needed for a Survey study', 'Marketplace Pricing & Operations Consulting', 'Data Modeling', 'Actuarial Data Scientist - Pricing Algorithm Development', 'Data analyst expert to make a timeseries forecast from sales data', 'DAC W2A Review Forecast', 'DAC W2A Review Forecast', 'Looking for a data scientist with strong machine learning skills', 'AI Data Scientist for Creating a Lookalike Model for B2B Account Pattern Matching', 'Pricing Strategy for Online Travel Agency', 'Develop a personal pricing strategy for 40k sku’s with 2k clients', 'Experienced Data Scientist']","['pandas', 'Data Science', 'Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Python Scikit-Learn', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Operations Research', 'PySpark', 'Statistics', 'Pricing', 'Pricing Research', 'Price Optimization', 'Generative Adversarial Network']"

9+ years experience with Amazon (since 2015)

Amazon / eCom BRAND GROWTH Expert. I help create 8-9 figure brands. DM

Super Easy first step = free audit. Just get in contact to check if you qualify.

And here will be a long-read story.

If you want to increase your sales on Amazon or outside Amazon, keep reading.

My name is Maksym Lazuto and I specialize in brand and sales growth.

I have been working with different Amazon brands and sellers since the end of 2015 (for now I think more than 300+ of them already).
I am studying the latest experience & technologies of Amazon business Sellers & Trainers weekly. Private courses, webinars, memberships, groups, communities, news, etc. 

I enjoy the strategy of a man who built a $100m/annual brand on Amazon with 30-40 products within one category/niche.
I will do my best to apply all the most useful practices to your business.

Just a few words about me – SALES.

DTC brands work a lot with us.

Numbers about me:
•	More than $30m in 2017 in sales 
•	More than 200 companies work with me
•	More than 3,000 listings are optimized
•	More than 15,000 advertising campaigns on Amazon launched/optimized
•	2015 - Starts my Amazon experience
Want to be a part of these numbers?

Let's start with my strong skills:
1.	High-competitive products.
2.	Aggressive marketing.
3.	Advertising on Amazon.
4.	Listing optimization.
5.	Product Ranking.
6.	Brand growth.

Many things affect sales. I know many of them and keep learning new.

What I'm focusing on?
Precisely what you will get:
1.	Sales growth.
2.	Brand growth.

I have saturated work experience, more than 100+ months with different Amazon sellers, from zero to $3m in monthly sales.
I enjoy it.

I have strong skills in Amazon Advertising (PPC), the latest updates of Amazon Search Engine (SEO) (Amazon A10 Algorithm), and the whole process of maximizing a product's potential. 
Primary skill – sales in general.

I am a member of a closed community of Amazon sellers, which means I have many valuable contacts. We can answer any questions. Some sellers are nine figures there on Amazon :D 

I have a complete package of plans, tools, and services for a growing brand from zero to $1m in about 24 months or less.

My main target — generate more sales.
My second target — achieve more results through long-term relationships.
To grow the brand from the current point, x2 x3 even x10.
Why? I love sales.

Send me a message, and we will boost your business to the moon!

I would be happy to share a few secrets that will increase Amazon sales in your case.

Some of the Amazon Business Courses helped me start my own Amazon business, including primary and advanced things in Seller Central, launching products, listing optimization, marketing, growing business up to $100,000/month, and others. I listen to over ten speakers who are already making over 6-7 figures monthly turnover there.

PhD Artificial Intelligence | Principal Data Scientist,$25.00/hr,"🎯 100% Satisfaction or Full Refund – I guarantee my work. If I don't meet your expectations or deliver as promised, you get your money back, no questions asked.

With 8 years of experience in Python and AI, and a PhD to back it up, I’ve worked with leading AI companies like Turing, OpenAI, and Reddit. As the founder of 5 AI companies operating across Taiwan, Germany, USA, and Pakistan, I’ve tackled a wide range of challenges in the AI landscape. You could say I'm an ""AI Guy,"" and I bring that expertise to every project I take on.

We’ll be a great fit if you need:

“I have a breakthrough idea and need an expert who truly gets AI”
“My industry is facing a complex problem, and I need a custom AI solution”
“I need a few critical features completed to secure our next funding round”
“We’re tired of off-the-shelf solutions and want to build something proprietary”
You’re dealing with inconsistent quality, rising costs, or unreliable partners
When you work with me, you’ll get: 

👉 Clean, scalable AI solutions built to handle exponential growth without a single hiccup
👉 Transparent, top-tier communication with constant feedback and updates
👉 On-time, on-budget delivery – 90%+ of my projects hit their marks, and so will yours
👉 Realistic expectations – I’ll tell you if something can’t be done within your timeline or budget
👉 A full refund if I over-promise or under-deliver. No hassle, no hard feelings
👉 Strategic, product-focused development to ensure every decision is backed by data

Clients love saying things like: 

⚡️ “It is always a great pleasure working with Muhammad and his team . They are very professional and transparent , great communication too”
⚡️ “Great experience. Attention to detail. Very responsive. Honest work with his team. Will definitely recommend”
⚡️ “Muhammad is an honest and transparent professional from Pakistan who exceeded my expectation to deliver a very technical AI project. He has access to a pool of talented scientists and quant analysts who work with full dedication. Definitely, recommended.”
⚡️ “Muhammad was amazing. He took a very difficult implementation and made a miracle in record time. He's the best I've worked it. I'm very happy with the results”

However, we might not be the best fit if: 

❌ Your project hinges solely on cutting costs
❌ You need an overnight turnaround – good AI takes time to build right
❌ Your project involves betting, adult entertainment, or questionable ethics
❌ You don’t value mutual respect and clear communication

Then I went on to Entertainment and Philanthropy contract positions with Live Earth, TED, and XPRIZE Foundation. 

With my own company, I have helped over 200 companies become more successful in their marketing strategies and campaigns.  I enjoy both small and large companies and very much like long term projects.

Google & Meta Ad Expert|10X ROAS|Strategist & Growth Partner,$55.00/hr,"I’m Keyla, and there’s a few things you should know about me:

I’m in the top 10% of Upwork Talent, with dozens of 5-star reviews
I have over a decade of experience in marketing
My clients routinely see 5x (or more!) ROI 
I’ve managed MILLIONS in ad spend, bringing businesses 6- and 7-figure profits

And I’m an Air Force veteran, which means I have the focus, drive, and adaptability to solve your problem and deliver results. 

Online marketing can be a challenge. You need someone in your corner who’s got a proven track record of providing customized, tactical solutions. Someone who can go on a full-scale online offensive and create a brand image that’s impossible to ignore. 

And if the military metaphors can’t convince you, maybe some of my happy clients can:

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “If you're considering a partnership with The Boss Level Agency, I wholeheartedly encourage you to move forward without hesitation. Our collaboration with them has been nothing short of excellent. They've driven a remarkable 93% surge in our online sales, and we're still seeing an ongoing upward trend.” 

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Hands down the best decision I ever made for my business was hiring these guys! Saw 50%ish growth in the first two months. Small price to pay for such a big outcome. Would recommend them twice if I could on here. Could not be happier!” 

Not convinced by the reviews? That’s okay, I’ve got case studies too. And these are just a small sample; you can see others on my profile:

We took an e-commerce store from “blah” to “blastoff,” increasing website traffic by 150% and doubling their sales. A technical audit to clear up website performance, a content overhaul, and a custom marketing plan helped the business soar.

We helped a plumbing company achieve an overwhelming 2100% increase in leads, while cutting their cost per lead by 85%! The company was willing to spend up to $10,000 a month on ads, but only if they saw results in an incredibly competitive field. We gave them the results they wanted and then some!

I don’t just work with businesses. Do you have a marketing agency that needs extra hands on deck for a project, or a committed partner to help you grow? I’d love to connect with you as well!

If you want explosive growth for your business and a long-term partner you can count on, you want to work with me. I take the time to listen to you and learn about your business, so that my team and I can create a marketing plan tailored to your needs. No cookie-cutter strategies here, just cutting-edge methodologies and tactics that rocket your brand to the head of the line.

Uncertainty is like a ticking time bomb for a business or an agency. When you work with me, I’ll defuse that bomb and bring clarity to your marketing strategy.

Just shoot me a message and take the first step in joining forces. Looking forward to working with you! 

To your victory,

Upwork Top 1 Percent - Guaranteed Email/SMS Marketing Revenue Growth,$27.00/hr,"Want to turn your brand and product promises into powerful messages that will make your client database take action?

Want to scale your eCommerce brand but worried about increased ad costs and shrinking margins?

Well, that’s a great sign.

These days eCommerce is only getting more cut-throat, with the large brands increasing click costs with their massive budgets.

But they're also focusing on something else...

They’re all obsessed with getting more repeat purchases, because they know this is where all the profit lies.

The cost for getting a new customer is getting more expensive each and every month

But selling to them again? Well, that's damn-near free, yet really effective.

See, netting 2nd and 3rd purchases from email have very little cost, which drastically increases a brand's revenue, profit margins, and customer lifetime value.

And this is what allows them to spend more on ads, outbidding you for the same clicks since they're far more profitable.

This is how the big boys scale so quickly.

And it's precisely how I've added up to 41% extra revenue, margin, and LTV to my client's Shopify brands.

Look...back in the days of cheap, breezy FB ad clicks, email marketing was a nice-to-have.

A luxury even.

But now advanced email marketing with a tool like Klaviyo is quickly becoming a straight-up pre-requisite to even compete.

And the brands that survive the next 3 years are those that invest in nurturing long term customers today before clicks truly skyrocket.

The sobering fact is, eCommerce now is all about retention - get customers, and keep them coming back for more.

This secret alone will allow you to bullet-proof your brand's cashflow, scale fast like the big dogs, and enjoy far more take-home profits.

However, as a Klaviyo Master, I already have a loyal stable of awesome clients - so naturally, my schedule is very nearly full.

But, if we get along and I'm 100% sure I can help your unique brand, then we might be able to do some great work together.

So if you're looking for someone to help you scale with Klaviyo email marketing, click the green ""Invite To Job"" or white ""Hire Now"" button at the top right of this page.

Looking forward to discussing your project :)

PS: Here's what clients have said about my email marketing services on Upwork:

Experienced Graphic Designer and Illustrator | Brand Identity Expert,$25.00/hr,"I see you need a logo…not a trivial one, copied from photo stocks, but a nice outstanding logo, an original one, that makes your brand unique and strong. Well, you came to the right place! I’ve got a superpower: I will develop a representative logo that will emphasize your brand’s strengths. In 7 years of practicing design magic, I mastered the Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects spells to deliver you a high-quality modern, and relevant brand identity. My designs are a mixture of creativity and collaboration with clients, and I move heaven and earth to see them happy and satisfied, so each time they look at their logo they relish it.

While creating a logotype I try my best to make it clear (almost minimalistic) and fill it with sense so the message translated by the brand is understandable and transparent. Every logo I make is a new experience, a challenging adventure for me no matter whether I'm working for a big corporation or a small studio, or a personal brand.

The biggest part of my portfolio is dedicated to Upgrade Academy - an educational institution for kids and teenagers. I contributed to this project as a brand and identity developer also created printables and Social Media visual content. My client's mission was to develop a friendly, transparent, modern brand associated with kids and teen education. We used bright, contrasting colors and a minimalistic style to make the brand look modern and bold. The next brand I developed a design for is Ride Safe - an application and also a social project dedicated to bikers and those who want to ride their motorcycles safely and consciously. Then goes a logo for VoodaLab - a software development company focused on creating mobile apps. The client wanted the logo to be not so serious, something funny and observable. After this I was invited to create the logotype for a social initiative called PECS kids, it works with autistic children and my mission was to combine in the logo the care for children and the puzzle - the official symbol of autism. The client liked the most second logo design. After this, I participated in a project that it's still in development. It's a messenger for people who want to spend their Friday evening in good company with some good drinks :) The client’s wish was --combining the night city landscape and the bar/party theme so we’ve got a cool modern and a bit romantic logo for the product.

💬 “I hired Nadejda to create a brand identity for my company. I was pleased by the results. And after that, she created a nice logo for our Android application and helped a lot with the application UI.
I definitely recommend her as a valuable specialist.” - Denis E. VoodaLab CEO

💬 “I wonder how Nadejda finds so quickly the inspiration for her logos. You just give her a task and the next day you have 3 different logo ideas to choose from. ” - Adelina, Fishka Dance Studio founder

💬 “Her logos are minimalistic, simple, and they describe well the brand essence and values. ” - Helen H, Upgrade Academy PR manager

My main specialization is brand identity development, including logo creation, designing brand books, and rebranding, but I’m also open to participating in projects as a vector illustrator, editorial designer, or photo editor.

If you decide to work with me, you will be guaranteed to receive the files in all needed formats - PNG, ESP, AI, JPEG. Also, you will receive colorful and realistic mockups with your logo to see how you can use it in real life. Creating a visual identity I develop a color and typographic guide that can be implemented in your app or website. 

I’m always seeking to obtain the best possible result, that's why I'm online and available for the biggest part of the day. The work will be delivered on time and you won’t have to worry and ask me if the work’s going or not. I will let you know about the work progress as soon as possible. I’m very responsible and adaptive to client’s needs and wishes, that’s why your every word will be taken into consideration.

Data Scientist | Google Analytics | HubSpot | Domo,$125.00/hr,"I am a data scientist who specializes in digital marketing analytics, Google Analytics 4 / Google Tag Manager, and customer behavioral analysis. 

I work primarily with e-commerce brands and B2Bs, but I also work with businesses in industries such as legal and professional services and real estate as well. 

I've recently completed GA4 projects for clients such as Vista Equity Partners, NASCAR, USAA, and AARP.

Web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager, play an indispensable role in today's business landscape. 

By tracking and analyzing user behavior, interaction patterns, and key performance indicators, these tools provide actionable insights that can drive decision-making and strategic planning. 

Understanding where visitors come from, what content they engage with, how they navigate through a site, and at what point they might leave, can uncover areas for optimization, allowing businesses to refine their marketing strategies, improve user experience, and increase conversion rates. 

Additionally, with real-time reporting, organizations can respond to trends quickly, adapting to market changes and maintaining a competitive edge. In an age where data-driven decisions are paramount to success, the investment in web analytics tools can often translate into increased revenue, customer retention, and overall business growth.

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) offers a host of advanced features and integrations that can provide valuable business intelligence to drive revenue. Here's how:

1. **Real-Time Data Analysis**: GA4's real-time reporting enables businesses to respond to trends and customer behaviors as they happen. This allows for immediate adjustments to marketing strategies or website content, ensuring optimal engagement and conversion.

2. **Audience Segmentation**: By understanding the different segments of an audience, businesses can create targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with specific groups. GA4's audience segmentation tools help identify these segments based on behavior, demographics, and interests, allowing for more personalized and effective marketing.

3. **Cross-Platform Tracking**: GA4's ability to track users across different devices and platforms gives a more holistic view of the customer journey. This can reveal insights into how different touchpoints influence purchasing decisions, enabling a more coordinated and efficient marketing approach.

4. **Predictive Metrics**: GA4 uses machine learning to offer predictive metrics, such as potential revenue from particular audience segments. This helps businesses to focus their efforts on the most promising areas, optimizing their return on investment.

5. **Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking**: By closely monitoring how users interact with products on a website, GA4 provides insights into which products are most appealing, the effectiveness of product recommendations, shopping cart abandonment rates, and more. This information is vital for optimizing product placement, pricing strategies, and overall ecommerce effectiveness.

6. **Integration with Advertising Platforms**: GA4's seamless integration with various advertising platforms, like Google Ads, means that businesses can manage and measure their advertising efforts within a unified environment. This ensures more precise targeting and measurement, driving a more efficient use of advertising budget.

7. **Custom Reporting and Dashboards**: GA4 allows for customized reporting that aligns with specific business goals and KPIs. This flexibility ensures that businesses have ready access to the most relevant data, empowering them to make informed decisions that align with their revenue-driving objectives.

8. **Compliance and Data Privacy**: With increased concerns over data privacy, GA4 has features to help businesses comply with regulations like GDPR. By maintaining compliance, businesses reduce the risk of legal issues that could impact revenue and reputation.

9. **Event Tracking and Automation**: GA4's event tracking capabilities allow businesses to understand user interactions at a granular level, such as clicks on specific buttons or form submissions. These insights can lead to the automation of specific responses, further optimizing user engagement and conversion pathways.

By leveraging these features, businesses can extract actionable insights, refine their strategies, and make data-driven decisions that align with their goals, ultimately leading to increased revenue.",338,"7,824",Carbondale,,100,"['Domo and Hubspot Developer', 'Web Analytics | GA4 | Segment | Domo | Google Tag Manager | Rev Ops', 'Review and optimize GTM - check and fix GA and Facebook and check all conversion tracking', 'looking for analytics setup measuring revenue related to SEO services', '60 minute consultation', 'Domo', '30 minute consultation', '30 minute consultation', '30 minute consultation', 'Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Google Tag Manager Audit and Ecommerce Tracking Implementation', 'Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager Troubleshooting Expert Needed', 'E-commerce Business Data Analyst', 'Senior Data Analyst - Churn (Metabase Experience Required)', 'Pull Information from Google Adwords & S3 to LookerStudio', 'Google Analytics 4 and Google Big Query expert']","['Data Analysis', 'Google Ads', 'Search Engine Optimization', 'Data Science', 'Data Modeling', 'Facebook Ads Manager', 'Data Visualization', 'Domo', 'Looker Studio', 'Data Mining', 'Paid Media', 'Machine Learning', 'Data Cleaning']"

Data Scientist | AI | Developer | ChatGPT Expert | Chatbot | GPT Tools,$30.00/hr,"Experienced Data Scientist with expertise in building AI tools for business workflows using GPT models. Skilled in developing applications integrated with OpenAI models using Streamlit and integrating ChatGPT into various use cases.

Proficient in Python, React, Node.js, and Next.js, my work is driven by a passion for problem-solving, innovative thinking, and a commitment to data-driven solutions.

I have built multiple tools and chatbots using OpenAI GPT models, and I have developed both front-end and back-end components. Some of my notable works are listed below:

Post-Surgery Patient Interaction Bot :
This MVP interacts with patients after surgery, collects feedback, understands their concerns, and guides them on the next steps for medical support. It also generates reports from these 
conversations and sends them directly to the specific doctor involved.

EazyBots :
An AI tool that helps you create custom website Bots, train them with your data, and customise them according to your website’s look. You will receive a URL that can be easily embedded into your website.

Lenny AI: 
This application features multiple chatbots for a finance company called Lenny. The tool is integrated with the company’s CRM to answer internal company questions about clients and workflows, review multiple files, and answer queries, among other tasks.

Resume Analyser: 
This is a personal project of mine, where you can upload multiple resumes, add criteria, and the tool will score the resumes based on your criteria.

SumUps:
Developed using the GPT-4 model, this tool analyses, summarises, and generates questions from large amounts of qualitative data in PDF, DOC, and tabular formats. It is designed for market research and policy data analysis.

Data Analysis Bot: 
Created a chatbot that allows you to ask questions based on your uploaded CSV data. The bot responds with text and charts.

Finacy :
A gamified finance literacy app for kids. I developed and integrated a chatbot that acts as a teacher, evaluating knowledge by asking questions and assessing answers using AI.

TaxGPT:
A WhatsApp bot built using GPT models, allowing users to ask tax-related questions in multiple languages, including Arabic, English, Spanish, German, and Hindi. The bot provides answers in simple language, drawing from a database of stored documents.

Digital Marketing Consultant,$310.00/hr,"Hi everyone!

My name is Haris Aslanidis. I’m the Founder of the Greek Geeks digital team, co-Founder of APE1R0N Digital Marketing Agency, and Head of Digital at VeSquad of Moro Global group. 

Gaining a lot of experience in computer evolution from a very young age, made me dream of following a career in that working field. So I made my dream come true by becoming an IT expert.

My career journey started as a Computer geek for several local businesses. I progressed to positions of increasing responsibility in larger Greek corporations until I finally decided to work abroad.
 
When I first started working in international positions, my level of English was very good, so it was suitable for the partnership, and I had success in the field of online presence for businesses, which resulted in positive comments and an increase in my rating. I currently have 24 years of Digital Marketing experience and that experience continues to grow on a daily basis because as a personality I'm always looking for innovative ideas, concepts, and goals to reach for. 
 
Because of the high unemployment rate in my country at the time, I founded my own agency, Greek Geeks, to help individuals find jobs remotely. With my knowledge and success, I considered I could use these abilities in order to build something bigger and better. 

Currently, we have more than 800 active contracts and our team consists of more than 40 people. Web and app development, graphic design, content generation, marketing strategy, and advertising are just some of the services we provide.

 More specifically, our services are:

* Social Media Consulting
* Digital Presence
* Digital Marketing Strategy
* Ads Conversion
* Public Relations
* Company Message Delivery to the audience
* Business Development

We also created the Ape1r0n Digital Universe, a greek business focusing on the Omni Channel digital presence of companies and the best possible results in mind. 
 
Additionally, I occupy the position of the Head of Digital at Vesquad, which is a subsidiary of Moro Global. We support startups and help them to grow having a partner mindset.

Digital Marketing Consultant,$310.00/hr,"Hi everyone!

My name is Haris Aslanidis. I’m the Founder of the Greek Geeks digital team, co-Founder of APE1R0N Digital Marketing Agency, and Head of Digital at VeSquad of Moro Global group. 

Gaining a lot of experience in computer evolution from a very young age, made me dream of following a career in that working field. So I made my dream come true by becoming an IT expert.

My career journey started as a Computer geek for several local businesses. I progressed to positions of increasing responsibility in larger Greek corporations until I finally decided to work abroad.
 
When I first started working in international positions, my level of English was very good, so it was suitable for the partnership, and I had success in the field of online presence for businesses, which resulted in positive comments and an increase in my rating. I currently have 24 years of Digital Marketing experience and that experience continues to grow on a daily basis because as a personality I'm always looking for innovative ideas, concepts, and goals to reach for. 
 
Because of the high unemployment rate in my country at the time, I founded my own agency, Greek Geeks, to help individuals find jobs remotely. With my knowledge and success, I considered I could use these abilities in order to build something bigger and better. 

Currently, we have more than 800 active contracts and our team consists of more than 40 people. Web and app development, graphic design, content generation, marketing strategy, and advertising are just some of the services we provide.

 More specifically, our services are:

* Social Media Consulting
* Digital Presence
* Digital Marketing Strategy
* Ads Conversion
* Public Relations
* Company Message Delivery to the audience
* Business Development

We also created the Ape1r0n Digital Universe, a greek business focusing on the Omni Channel digital presence of companies and the best possible results in mind. 
 
Additionally, I occupy the position of the Head of Digital at Vesquad, which is a subsidiary of Moro Global. We support startups and help them to grow having a partner mindset.

Furthermore, I and two of my partners created a website, Spoudaia Events, which is a non-profit organization, solely for philanthropic purposes and events for NGOs.

When I'm not working, I enjoy traveling, attending concerts and sports events, discovering new locations, visiting friends all around the world, participating in never-ending education seminars, reading books, watching movies, listening to music, and developing new, innovative ideas. 

I believe that everyone has to offer something to this world that we are living in and I'm trying my best regarding this part as I encourage every single one of you to do the same.

Let’s make an impact!

"Social Media Marketing, Digital Advertising and E-Commerce Sales",$15.00/hr,"With my MBA and over 15 years of extensive experience in digital marketing, sales, and advertising, I've honed my skills as a social media marketer, holding credentials from Meta (October 2023), Facebook, Instagram, Google, and YouTube. I worked with prominent brands in the US as well as with Silicon Valley software companies, American healthcare firms, and British e-commerce businesses.

Social Media & Content:
I'm confident in my ability to deliver results, including a minimum 1.2x return on your investment within four months. If you're not satisfied, you won't have to pay a single penny (Given that Blue Stout, a CRO agency in the US, guarantees a 2x return on investment, I'm well-acquainted with this practice). Working with Monginis, a food and beverage brand, I increased their e-commerce website sales revenues by a staggering 10x without paid ads.

I'm a seasoned expert in crafting and producing English content for a wide range of mediums, including email newsletters, social media posts, captions, videos, company profiles, website pages, and more.

During my tenure as a full-time digital marketing manager at the UK-based Deventi Group, I led the growth of Claritas Books' online sales revenues year over year by an impressive 50%. Furthermore, I elevated website traffic from social media from 10% to a remarkable 30%. I achieved a 3x increase in the growth of subscribers for their YouTube channel (Already has millions of subscribers). Our collaboration with UNHCR (UN organization) leveraged the digital presence of their Swedish musician Maher Zain (35 million followers on Instagram and Facebook) as the top source of donations and traffic to their website.

For VIVA Investment Partners, headquartered in Switzerland, I effectively crafted their content, including email marketing (all in English), for 2 years including the 2022 and 2021 annual conference ""Follow the Entrepreneur,"" resulting in impressive year-over-year growth:
+28% in LinkedIn followers
+953% in Twitter followers
+526% in Instagram followers
+3% in Facebook fans
+144% in YouTube views
+63% in YouTube subscribers

For Unifonic, a Dubai-based IT solutions regional giant, I achieved a 50% increase in website traffic and an 18% increase in traffic from Facebook.

What Makes Me Unique:
I'm among the select few social media and digital marketing freelancers who prioritize delivering tangible results and measurable outcomes over boasting impressive client lists. If you're investing in digital marketing activities but not achieving the desired sales growth, you can rely on me to swiftly identify the root causes. In just a 30-minute call, I can share my screen, guiding you through your customer journey, highlighting and addressing issues that prevent your website visitors, ad audience, or social media followers from converting (e.g., making purchases or subscribing). You can rely on me for transparent communication regarding my capabilities, my willingness to learn and adapt, and when I may need assistance from others.

Besides my extensive 15 years of experience and an MBA degree, I've received enthusiastic reviews and recommendations from clients in both the US and the UK, both on Upwork and LinkedIn. Several have been pleasantly surprised by my nearly native-level proficiency in English, a credit to my prior work experience with UK and US-based organizations, and my university and post-graduate degrees, which were conducted in English

I am your all-in-one digital marketing solution. My IT engineering background equips me to handle various technical aspects, including expertise in YouTube and Facebook copyrights, monetization, and the management of websites and landing pages on platforms such as Unbounce, Shopify, PrestaShop, WordPress, Magento, SquareSpace, Blogger, and others. My certificates, some were earned through training courses at Google's Dubai premises, attest to my proficiency.

In addition to the mentioned tools, I am well-versed in a plethora of platforms and AI applications, including HubSpot, Windows Movie Editor, Canva, Active Campaign, iContact, Trello, Slack, Moz, Mailchimp, Hootsuite, Buffer, Sprout Social, Mention, Bit.ly, Google Trends, Hotjar, Loom, Tinyurl, and more.

I've joined the United Nations as a social media consultant.

I’ve pioneered a custom retention, email, & SMS marketing strategy blueprint to boost e-commerce brands’ store revenues by an extra 20-50% within 60-90 days, consistently.

Instead of the generic, wide-net approach you’ve seen before, I place my focus more on strategically crafting personalized content & messages using proven customer retention strategies to convert & retain your ideal customers more effectively.

Here’s what to expect from a true email & retention expert partnering with your brand:

- Larger, more qualified email list (more subscribers = more opportunities = more buyers)
- Better email deliverability (never land in the spam folder)
- Increased conversion rates on flows and campaigns (open rates, click-through rates)
- Higher customer retention (revenue per recipient, customer lifetime value)
- Continuous management of flows, forms, list, and campaigns
- Continuous optimization of flows, forms, and campaigns
- Monthly, highly-personalized strategy plans
- Deliverability assessments, reporting, and optimizations
- App integration set-up & management

In 2024, it’s crucial that your e-commerce store has high-converting backend marketing systems to keep you not only top of mind with your customers, but also boost your bottom line to give your store that extra push in revenue every month.

I’ll do everything from:

- In-depth auditing of your Klaviyo (or platform of choice) account
- Custom, personalized strategic planning of email/SMS flows & campaigns
- Creating & setting up all email/SMS flows
- Sending out of weekly email/SMS campaigns
- Weekly email/SMS campaign performance reviews
- Monthly email/SMS flow performance & list growth reviews
- Cleaning, segmenting, and managing your email/SMS list
- Technical & creative split-testing of emails/SMS
- Meeting with you to align your marketing with monthly strategy plans

All you have to do is get set up with me and I’ll do the rest so you can focus on growing your business.

Now, here's what I’d love to do if you’re open to it, let's chat over a discovery call where we can:

- Dive into your business & overall marketing goals
- Pinpoint the hurdles holding back your e-commerce store’s growth
- See if I can strengthen your back-end systems (if we’re a good fit)

If you’re truly committed to elevating your e-commerce store’s revenue & profits, and eager to see tangible results, then hit the “Message” button at the top right of this page and let's schedule a time to see how I can help your brand.

IMPORTANT! Before contacting me ask yourself: 

1. Do I have the necessary data for this project? (I'd very rarely be able to provide data for your project.)

2. Is the data suitably prepared for a machine learning project? (If not, there will necessarily be a stage for EDA and ETL which normally takes some time.)

3. Is it really feasible given the current machine learning state-of-art? (Some ideas are simply either too far from reality or demand a large amount of investment for becoming real.)

4. Do I have enough budget to afford this project? (Be realistic about the project you're proposing.)

My years of experience in data analytics, BI tools, large-scale database development, schema structures, and cloud expertise allow me to quickly understand and translate your business needs, providing valuable advice and solutions for your data.

One of Success Story:
I increased 𝘀𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 by up to 𝟮𝟴% for a US-based airline company by implementing predictive maintenance strategies. Through data visualization of sensor data from aircraft components, I discovered 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 that maintenance issues were causing long-term sales decreases. To address this, I developed a dashboard to monitor all aircraft health maintenance activities. This led to a reduction in unscheduled downtime and flight cancellations, resulting in improved operational efficiency. These enhancements significantly boosted customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately driving sales growth.
So I will translate your business requirements and after doing data analysis and data visualization I hope I can recommend such strategies that can be super helpful in your business.

The struggle is real...

You've built your website. You've spent hours tirelessly writing the content. But you're still not getting any Google love!

Then repeat after me:

“The ‘publish and pray’ method does NOT work.”

If you’re not building backlinks, you’re going to struggle to get search engine traffic.

There are over 200 ranking factors and link building is still the #1 determining factor. 

In fact, if you do nothing else and ONLY focus on links, you have a better chance at building a high-traffic blog than if you were to do everything BUT link building.

Here's what I do:

1) I find similar articles in your niche with lots of links

2) I create a list of everyone who linked to that similar article and their email address 

3) You (or your team) will write the article and I'll support you in ensuring it becomes a highly linkable asset.

4) I reach out to every prospect from step 2 and say something along the lines of 'hey - great website, love the article you've linked to - and I've created a similar article here...you may want to link to it'

Sound good? Well hold your horses...

Before you send me an offer—as many people do every week—you need to know something: I am CRAZY busy.

So here's the catch:

If your budget is less than a minimum of $1,000 per month—I’ll decline it.

And if you don't truly understand the value of link building and the returns it brings, I’ll decline it.

This isn't a marketing ploy. And it's not that I'm trying to be rude. 

It's just that if you become my client, you get my absolute best... and right now I'm working serious overtime, helping my clients to grow their websites and generate that sweet Google love.

👇 If you think we’re a good fit, here is how it will work 👇

2) Once I have a good understanding, I will give you a tailored strategy and give you some insight on what I can do to help

3)We either move forward together and you become a client of mine, where I implement the plan to massively increase profit and consistency of sales… or, we decide to part ways and you take action on your own (and that is completely fine, too).

The potential upside is HUGE, and the downside…

Well…you walk away with a FREE strategy call (worth over $497) and gain insight on how to scale your business.

Cold Email Campaign Manager | Outreach Expert | LinkedIn Marketing,$30.00/hr,"Have you heard the story of Unbounce?

With only $850,000 in funding in 2011, the company did $12.5M in revenues for 2015. And before that funding, they bootstrapped.

How did they reach this success without spending millions of dollars on advertising? 

Sure, they had a great product. But according to their CEO, Rick Perreault, it came down to creating amazing content for their audience from day one.

“The Question We Had From The Beginning Was ‘How Are We Going To Find Customers? People Didn’t Even Know To Look For Us, So How Will We Go Out And Find Them? So That Was A Really Important Challenge For Us To Tackle, And We Made The Decision To Start Blogging On Day One.""

-Rick Perreault, CEO Of Unbounce

This is how I help businesses.

By helping them create a winning content strategy.

The crux of the strategy is to create the most helpful content for your target audience, and promote the shit out of it.

Each of our blog post takes around 10 to 20 hours to research and write the best post on the topic.

These are not 500 words blog posts, but a complete resource (over ~2000 words) on the topic that we make sure that the target audience is interested in.

If you're seriously considering investing in content marketing, then I can help you get results.

And why wouldn't you consider content marketing? 

After all, it has an influence over other strategies.

Your content marketing efforts can have an affect on almost any other online strategy you have. For example:

* Want people signing up to your email list? Content can drive that.
	
* Working on SEO strategy? Relevant, quality content can help drive traffic and boost your SEO.
	
* Wondering what to post on social media? Sharing your blog posts is one important strategy.
	
* Want to find a way to connect with influencers or make other valuable contacts? Mentioning them in your content gives you a good excuse to reach out on social media.

* Looking for a better way to onboard your SaaS sign ups and give them the information they need for success? Do it with content!

Basically, content can form the basis of many of your other strategies, including as a lure to drive more traffic to your website.

"Email Marketing (Klaviyo, GoHighLevel, Mailchimp) | Virtual Assistant",$10.00/hr,"Is your email marketing making noise or making money?

Let's get straight to the point: I’m the email marketing specialist who turns your inbox into a goldmine. Whether you’re in e-commerce, SaaS, real estate, or selling artisanal dog treats, my mission is simple—craft emails that don’t just sit pretty in someone’s inbox but demand attention, drive clicks, and most importantly, make your cash register sing.

I’ve been knee-deep in the email marketing world for years, juggling platforms like Klaviyo, GoHighLevel, Mailchimp, and a bunch of others you might not have heard of (but trust me, they’re game-changers). I’m not just here to talk open rates and click-throughs—I’m here to talk about how email marketing can be your silent salesperson, working 24/7 to bring in business while you sleep.

I’ve worked with businesses of all shapes and sizes, from scrappy startups to established enterprises, B2B or B2C—it doesn’t matter. What matters is understanding the psychology of your audience and crafting messages that speak directly to their needs, desires, and even their pain points. I’m all about creating that “hell yes” moment where they see your email and just have to take action.

Here’s what I bring to the table:

~ Strategic Campaigns: I design email campaigns that align with your business goals, whether that’s boosting sales, increasing engagement, or launching a new product.
~ Automation Mastery: From drip campaigns to complex workflows, I build automated systems that nurture leads, drive repeat purchases, and save you time.
~ Data-Driven Decisions: Numbers don’t lie. I analyze the heck out of your data to optimize and tweak campaigns, ensuring every email is better than the last.
~ Copy That Converts: Writing emails isn’t just about being clever; it’s about being effective. My copy doesn’t just sound good—it works.
~ Segmentation & Personalization: Not all customers are the same, and neither should your emails be. I’ll help you talk to the right people, at the right time, with the right message.

With a track record of delighting clients and achieving outstanding results, I'm eager to become your strategic partner in driving growth and engagement.

My approach is simple yet effective: I prioritize your goals and tailor strategies that resonate with your unique brand identity. 

I'm selective in collaborations, favoring partners committed to shared success. Please note, I typically engage in medium to long-term projects and may decline other commitments that involve:

❌ Micromanagement and unattainably high demands.
❌ Immediate results from Facebook Ads without acknowledging the process.
❌ Expect me to respond to your messages every 5 minutes or less.
❌ Short-term, one-off tasks like pixel setup and error troubleshooting.

I take pride in fostering positive, collaborative relationships and going the extra mile to ensure that your needs are met and exceeded. 

My commitment to client satisfaction goes beyond strategy – I take pride in cultivating collaborative relationships and exceeding expectations.

I am here to provide transparent communication, timely updates, and strategic insights that keep you informed every step of the way. 

Whether you're seeking to boost sales, expand your online presence, or engage with a wider audience, I'm well-equipped to help you navigate the ever-evolving landscape of Facebook and Instagram advertising.

When it comes to digital marketing, I handle everything from A to Z.
I work with brands to clearly identify their customer avatars, pain points, target audience’s specific language, and how best to position their brand and offers to convert. 

I take a holistic approach to marketing and advertising. Where most freelancers or agencies focus on just one area of a business (causing disconnect and lack of insights), I look at multiple facets of your business. This comprehensive view helps me identify and address gaps in your sales and marketing processes—ensuring a cohesive and effective strategy.

I help brands with the following:

✅  𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝘂𝗱𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆 𝗕𝗹𝘂𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 In-depth analysis of your sales and marketing channels and the creation of actionable plans to 𝟮𝗫 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘁𝗵.

✅  𝗣𝗮𝗶𝗱 𝗦𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝗱𝘀: Strategic planning, audience and competitor research, compelling and persuasive ad copywriting, eye-catching and scroll-stopping ad creative designs and development, conversion-optimized ad campaign setup, A/B split testing and ongoing ad account optimization to scale profitably  🚀 on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, & Google.

Here's what just a few of my clients have had to say about working with me:

🌟 ""Jennifer and the ROI Jolt team are thorough, fast and talented. They are highly responsive, and build great performing advertising campaigns. I highly recommend Jennifer and ROI Jolt to anyone looking for a great Facebook Advertising management team. I plan on working with them in the future, because I am very happy with the results we have gotten with them thus far. They put a TON of effort into messaging, creative and campaign building. They manage the campaign, the bids and creative optimizations for you. Their messaging pops and performs very well.""

🌟 ""Jennifer is highly knowledgeable and worked to understand our business so she could provide the most valuable work for us. We hired her because we didn't believe the numbers provided by our prior Facebook consultant, and Jennifer worked to discover how analytics were being miscounted and then she created and implemented a new campaign that we approved. When the actual numbers proved our prior suspicions, she didn't lie to us like our prior consultant did. She advised us to go another route. Her assistance was invaluable.""

🌟 ""Jen and the ROI Jolt team were amazing to work with! We partnered with ROI Jolt to help set up an email marketing strategy for a D2C e-commerce client. They recommended the appropriate email marketing software to accommodate our WooCommerce/WordPress website and suggested a handful of awesome automation flows and email campaigns to support the client's initiatives. From initial introductions to onboarding, set up, follow through, and project delivery - the entire process was seamless, timely, and efficient. ROI Jolt adopted the visual identity of the brand along with the voice of the brand for email copywriting quickly. I'd highly recommend Jennifer and ROI JOLT to any business that needs email marketing strategy and implementation.""

🌟 ""Jennifer and her team went above and beyond to help us. Her company is the perfect size to have talented resources available to get the job done in a timely manner, but not so big that you feel lost in the numbers. She made me feel like she was thinking about our startup company's success even beyond our scope of work with ROI Jolt.""

My years of experience in data analytics, BI tools, large-scale database development, schema structures, and cloud expertise allow me to quickly understand and translate your business needs, providing valuable advice and solutions for your data.

One of Success Story:
I increased 𝘀𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 by up to 𝟮𝟴% for a US-based airline company by implementing predictive maintenance strategies. Through data visualization of sensor data from aircraft components, I discovered 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 that maintenance issues were causing long-term sales decreases. To address this, I developed a dashboard to monitor all aircraft health maintenance activities. This led to a reduction in unscheduled downtime and flight cancellations, resulting in improved operational efficiency. These enhancements significantly boosted customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately driving sales growth.
So I will translate your business requirements and after doing data analysis and data visualization I hope I can recommend such strategies that can be super helpful in your business.

* Professional level design of PowerBI dashboards for CEO, CFO, and other senior management users,

* Team collaboration in an agile environment, managing both junior analysts and BI developers and
* Mentoring, training, coaching, and a passion for data analytics.

Graphic Designer | Logo Design & Visual Identity Designer,$50.00/hr,"Hello there!

As an expert visual artist and graphic designer with 7+ years of experience, I can make your brand stand out and get noticed. Good design stands at the crossroads of function and beauty. It engages, compels, and makes perfect sense. This is what I strive to give my clients.

I believe good branding is more than creating eye-appealing visual. It should also display the brand personality and speak to the audience on an emotional level. It is the key to communicate your message to the target audience effectively. 

My process aims to unearth and communicate the intangible essence of a brand that people fall in love with. From its behaviour to its products; I believe every company has a story to tell and that design can be the most powerful way to tell it.

Brand identity design is the special sauce that can help your business to differentiate from others. Let’s cook it together. I develop a brand language and design system to express your brand powerfully. I create the foundations of your visual identity: from logo and colour palette through to bespoke typography and imagery.

Whether you’re a larger organization, small company or an individual, I treat every project with the same high degree of ambition and attention to detail with fast turnaround time and effective communication. I have the agility and creativity to meet challenges of all sizes.

• Logo Design
